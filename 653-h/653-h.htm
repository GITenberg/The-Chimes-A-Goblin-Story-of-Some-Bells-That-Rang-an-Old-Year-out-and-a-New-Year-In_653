<h1>THE CHIMES<br />
A Goblin Story</h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br
/>
SOME BELLS THAT RANG AN OLD YEAR OUT<br />
AND A NEW YEAR IN</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;First Quarter.</h2>
<p>There are not many people&mdash;and as it is desirable that a
story-teller and a story-reader should establish a mutual
understanding as soon as possible, I beg it to be noticed that I
confine this observation neither to young people nor to little
people, but extend it to all conditions of people: little and
big, young and old: yet growing up, or already growing down
again&mdash;there are not, I say, many people who would care to
sleep in a church.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean at sermon-time in
warm weather (when the thing has actually been done, once or
twice), but in the night, and alone.&nbsp; A great multitude of
persons will be violently astonished, I know, by this position,
in the broad bold Day.&nbsp; But it applies to Night.&nbsp; It
must be argued by night, and I will undertake to maintain it
successfully on any gusty winter&rsquo;s night appointed for the
purpose, with any one opponent chosen from the rest, who will
meet me singly in an old churchyard, before an old church-door;
and will previously empower me to lock him in, if needful to his
satisfaction, until morning.</p>
<p>For the night-wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and
round a building of that sort, and moaning as it goes; and of
trying, with its unseen hand, the windows and the doors; and
seeking out some crevices by which to enter.&nbsp; And when it
has got in; as one not finding what it seeks, whatever that may
be, it wails and howls to issue forth again: and not content with
stalking through the aisles, and gliding round and round the
pillars, and tempting the deep organ, soars up to the roof, and
strives to rend the rafters: then flings itself despairingly upon
the stones below, and passes, muttering, into the vaults.&nbsp;
Anon, it comes up stealthily, and creeps along the walls, seeming
to read, in whispers, the Inscriptions sacred to the Dead.&nbsp;
At some of these, it breaks out shrilly, as with laughter; and at
others, moans and cries as if it were lamenting.&nbsp; It has a
ghostly sound too, lingering within the altar; where it seems to
chaunt, in its wild way, of Wrong and Murder done, and false Gods
worshipped, in defiance of the Tables of the Law, which look so
fair and smooth, but are so flawed and broken.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp;
Heaven preserve us, sitting snugly round the fire!&nbsp; It has
an awful voice, that wind at Midnight, singing in a church!</p>
<p>But, high up in the steeple!&nbsp; There the foul blast roars
and whistles!&nbsp; High up in the steeple, where it is free to
come and go through many an airy arch and loophole, and to twist
and twine itself about the giddy stair, and twirl the groaning
weathercock, and make the very tower shake and shiver!&nbsp; High
up in the steeple, where the belfry is, and iron rails are ragged
with rust, and sheets of lead and copper, shrivelled by the
changing weather, crackle and heave beneath the unaccustomed
tread; and birds stuff shabby nests into corners of old oaken
joists and beams; and dust grows old and grey; and speckled
spiders, indolent and fat with long security, swing idly to and
fro in the vibration of the bells, and never loose their hold
upon their thread-spun castles in the air, or climb up
sailor-like in quick alarm, or drop upon the ground and ply a
score of nimble legs to save one life!&nbsp; High up in the
steeple of an old church, far above the light and murmur of the
town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it, is the wild
and dreary place at night: and high up in the steeple of an old
church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.</p>
<p>They were old Chimes, trust me.&nbsp; Centuries ago, these
Bells had been baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that
the register of their baptism was lost long, long before the
memory of man, and no one knew their names.&nbsp; They had had
their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells (for my own part, by
the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of being
Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had their silver mugs no
doubt, besides.&nbsp; But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and
Henry the Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung,
nameless and mugless, in the church-tower.</p>
<p>Not speechless, though.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; They had
clear, loud, lusty, sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and
wide they might be heard upon the wind.&nbsp; Much too sturdy
Chimes were they, to be dependent on the pleasure of the wind,
moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it when it took an
adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes into a
listening ear right royally; and bent on being heard on stormy
nights, by some poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone
wife whose husband was at sea, they had been sometimes known to
beat a blustering Nor&rsquo; Wester; aye, &lsquo;all to
fits,&rsquo; as Toby Veck said;&mdash;for though they chose to
call him Trotty Veck, his name was Toby, and nobody could make it
anything else either (except Tobias) without a special act of
parliament; he having been as lawfully christened in his day as
the Bells had been in theirs, though with not quite so much of
solemnity or public rejoicing.</p>
<p>For my part, I confess myself of Toby Veck&rsquo;s belief, for
I am sure he had opportunities enough of forming a correct
one.&nbsp; And whatever Toby Veck said, I say.&nbsp; And I take
my stand by Toby Veck, although he <i>did</i> stand all day long
(and weary work it was) just outside the church-door.&nbsp; In
fact he was a ticket-porter, Toby Veck, and waited there for
jobs.</p>
<p>And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed, stony-toed,
tooth-chattering place it was, to wait in, in the winter-time, as
Toby Veck well knew.&nbsp; The wind came tearing round the
corner&mdash;especially the east wind&mdash;as if it had sallied
forth, express, from the confines of the earth, to have a blow at
Toby.&nbsp; And oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than
it had expected, for bouncing round the corner, and passing Toby,
it would suddenly wheel round again, as if it cried &lsquo;Why,
here he is!&rsquo;&nbsp; Incontinently his little white apron
would be caught up over his head like a naughty boy&rsquo;s
garments, and his feeble little cane would be seen to wrestle and
struggle unavailingly in his hand, and his legs would undergo
tremendous agitation, and Toby himself all aslant, and facing now
in this direction, now in that, would be so banged and buffeted,
and touzled, and worried, and hustled, and lifted off his
feet, as to render it a state of things but one degree removed
from a positive miracle, that he wasn&rsquo;t carried up bodily
into the air as a colony of frogs or snails or other very
portable creatures sometimes are, and rained down again, to the
great astonishment of the natives, on some strange corner of the
world where ticket-porters are unknown.</p>
<p>But, windy weather, in spite of its using him so roughly, was,
after all, a sort of holiday for Toby.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
fact.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to wait so long for a sixpence
in the wind, as at other times; the having to fight with that
boisterous element took off his attention, and quite freshened
him up, when he was getting hungry and low-spirited.&nbsp; A hard
frost too, or a fall of snow, was an Event; and it seemed to do
him good, somehow or other&mdash;it would have been hard to say
in what respect though, Toby!&nbsp; So wind and frost and snow,
and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail, were Toby Veck&rsquo;s
red-letter days.</p>
<p>Wet weather was the worst; the cold, damp, clammy wet, that
wrapped him up like a moist great-coat&mdash;the only kind of
great-coat Toby owned, or could have added to his comfort by
dispensing with.&nbsp; Wet days, when the rain came slowly,
thickly, obstinately down; when the street&rsquo;s throat, like
his own, was choked with mist; when smoking umbrellas passed and
re-passed, spinning round and round like so many teetotums, as
they knocked against each other on the crowded footway, throwing
off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when gutters
brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy; when the wet from
the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip, drip,
drip, on Toby, making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere
mud in no time; those were the days that tried him.&nbsp; Then,
indeed, you might see Toby looking anxiously out from his shelter
in an angle of the church wall&mdash;such a meagre shelter that
in summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good-sized
walking stick upon the sunny pavement&mdash;with a disconsolate
and lengthened face.&nbsp; But coming out, a minute afterwards,
to warm himself by exercise, and trotting up and down some dozen
times, he would brighten even then, and go back more brightly to
his niche.</p>
<p>They called him Trotty from his pace, which meant speed if it
didn&rsquo;t make it.&nbsp; He could have walked faster perhaps;
most likely; but rob him of his trot, and Toby would have taken
to his bed and died.&nbsp; It bespattered him with mud in dirty
weather; it cost him a world of trouble; he could have walked
with infinitely greater ease; but that was one reason for his
clinging to it so tenaciously.&nbsp; A weak, small, spare old
man, he was a very Hercules, this Toby, in his good
intentions.&nbsp; He loved to earn his money.&nbsp; He delighted
to believe&mdash;Toby was very poor, and couldn&rsquo;t well
afford to part with a delight&mdash;that he was worth his
salt.&nbsp; With a shilling or an eighteenpenny message or small
parcel in hand, his courage always high, rose higher.&nbsp; As he
trotted on, he would call out to fast Postmen ahead of him, to
get out of the way; devoutly believing that in the natural course
of things he must inevitably overtake and run them down; and he
had perfect faith&mdash;not often tested&mdash;in his being able
to carry anything that man could lift.</p>
<p>Thus, even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a
wet day, Toby trotted.&nbsp; Making, with his leaky shoes, a
crooked line of slushy footprints in the mire; and blowing on his
chilly hands and rubbing them against each other, poorly defended
from the searching cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted,
with a private apartment only for the thumb, and a common room or
tap for the rest of the fingers; Toby, with his knees bent and
his cane beneath his arm, still trotted.&nbsp; Falling out into
the road to look up at the belfry when the Chimes resounded, Toby
trotted still.</p>
<p>He made this last excursion several times a day, for they were
company to him; and when he heard their voices, he had an
interest in glancing at their lodging-place, and thinking how
they were moved, and what hammers beat upon them.&nbsp; Perhaps
he was the more curious about these Bells, because there were
points of resemblance between themselves and him.&nbsp; They hung
there, in all weathers, with the wind and rain driving in upon
them; facing only the outsides of all those houses; never getting
any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the
windows, or came puffing out of the chimney tops; and incapable
of participation in any of the good things that were constantly
being handed through the street doors and the area railings, to
prodigious cooks.&nbsp; Faces came and went at many windows:
sometimes pretty faces, youthful faces, pleasant faces: sometimes
the reverse: but Toby knew no more (though he often speculated on
these trifles, standing idle in the streets) whence they came, or
where they went, or whether, when the lips moved, one kind word
was said of him in all the year, than did the Chimes
themselves.</p>
<p>Toby was not a casuist&mdash;that he knew of, at
least&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean to say that when he began to
take to the Bells, and to knit up his first rough acquaintance
with them into something of a closer and more delicate woof, he
passed through these considerations one by one, or held any
formal review or great field-day in his thoughts.&nbsp; But what
I mean to say, and do say is, that as the functions of
Toby&rsquo;s body, his digestive organs for example, did of their
own cunning, and by a great many operations of which he was
altogether ignorant, and the knowledge of which would have
astonished him very much, arrive at a certain end; so his mental
faculties, without his privity or concurrence, set all these
wheels and springs in motion, with a thousand others, when they
worked to bring about his liking for the Bells.</p>
<p>And though I had said his love, I would not have recalled the
word, though it would scarcely have expressed his complicated
feeling.&nbsp; For, being but a simple man, he invested them with
a strange and solemn character.&nbsp; They were so mysterious,
often heard and never seen; so high up, so far off, so full of
such a deep strong melody, that he regarded them with a species
of awe; and sometimes when he looked up at the dark arched
windows in the tower, he half expected to be beckoned to by
something which was not a Bell, and yet was what he had heard so
often sounding in the Chimes.&nbsp; For all this, Toby scouted
with indignation a certain flying rumour that the Chimes were
haunted, as implying the possibility of their being connected
with any Evil thing.&nbsp; In short, they were very often in his
ears, and very often in his thoughts, but always in his good
opinion; and he very often got such a crick in his neck by
staring with his mouth wide open, at the steeple where they hung,
that he was fain to take an extra trot or two, afterwards, to
cure it.</p>
<p>The very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day, when
the last drowsy sound of Twelve o&rsquo;clock, just struck, was
humming like a melodious monster of a Bee, and not by any means a
busy bee, all through the steeple!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner-time, eh!&rsquo; said Toby, trotting up and down
before the church.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby&rsquo;s nose was very red, and his eyelids were very red,
and he winked very much, and his shoulders were very near his
ears, and his legs were very stiff, and altogether he was
evidently a long way upon the frosty side of cool.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner-time, eh!&rsquo; repeated Toby, using his
right-hand muffler like an infantine boxing-glove, and punishing
his chest for being cold.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah-h-h-h!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took a silent trot, after that, for a minute or two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said Toby, breaking forth
afresh&mdash;but here he stopped short in his trot, and with a
face of great interest and some alarm, felt his nose carefully
all the way up.&nbsp; It was but a little way (not being much of
a nose) and he had soon finished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it was gone,&rsquo; said Toby, trotting off
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, however.&nbsp; I am
sure I couldn&rsquo;t blame it if it was to go.&nbsp; It has a
precious hard service of it in the bitter weather, and precious
little to look forward to; for I don&rsquo;t take snuff
myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good deal tried, poor creetur, at the
best of times; for when it <i>does</i> get hold of a pleasant
whiff or so (which an&rsquo;t too often) it&rsquo;s generally
from somebody else&rsquo;s dinner, a-coming home from the
baker&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reflection reminded him of that other reflection, which he
had left unfinished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said Toby, &lsquo;more
regular in its coming round than dinner-time, and nothing less
regular in its coming round than dinner.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
great difference between &rsquo;em.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s took me a
long time to find it out.&nbsp; I wonder whether it would be
worth any gentleman&rsquo;s while, now, to buy that obserwation
for the Papers; or the Parliament!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby was only joking, for he gravely shook his head in
self-depreciation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why! Lord!&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Papers is
full of obserwations as it is; and so&rsquo;s the
Parliament.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s last week&rsquo;s paper,
now;&rsquo; taking a very dirty one from his pocket, and holding
it from him at arm&rsquo;s length; &lsquo;full of
obserwations!&nbsp; Full of obserwations!&nbsp; I like to know
the news as well as any man,&rsquo; said Toby, slowly; folding it
a little smaller, and putting it in his pocket again: &lsquo;but
it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper
now.&nbsp; It frightens me almost.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
we poor people are coming to.&nbsp; Lord send we may be coming to
something better in the New Year nigh upon us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father, father!&rsquo; said a pleasant voice, hard
by.</p>
<p>But Toby, not hearing it, continued to trot backwards and
forwards: musing as he went, and talking to himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems as if we can&rsquo;t go right, or do right, or
be righted,&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t much
schooling, myself, when I was young; and I can&rsquo;t make out
whether we have any business on the face of the earth, or
not.&nbsp; Sometimes I think we must have&mdash;a little; and
sometimes I think we must be intruding.&nbsp; I get so puzzled
sometimes that I am not even able to make up my mind whether
there is any good at all in us, or whether we are born bad.&nbsp;
We seem to be dreadful things; we seem to give a deal of trouble;
we are always being complained of and guarded against.&nbsp; One
way or other, we fill the papers.&nbsp; Talk of a New
Year!&rsquo; said Toby, mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can bear up as
well as another man at most times; better than a good many, for I
am as strong as a lion, and all men an&rsquo;t; but supposing it
should really be that we have no right to a New
Year&mdash;supposing we really <i>are</i>
intruding&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father, father!&rsquo; said the pleasant voice
again.</p>
<p>Toby heard it this time; started; stopped; and shortening his
sight, which had been directed a long way off as seeking the
enlightenment in the very heart of the approaching year, found
himself face to face with his own child, and looking close into
her eyes.</p>
<p>Bright eyes they were.&nbsp; Eyes that would bear a world of
looking in, before their depth was fathomed.&nbsp; Dark eyes,
that reflected back the eyes which searched them; not flashingly,
or at the owner&rsquo;s will, but with a clear, calm, honest,
patient radiance, claiming kindred with that light which Heaven
called into being.&nbsp; Eyes that were beautiful and true, and
beaming with Hope.&nbsp; With Hope so young and fresh; with Hope
so buoyant, vigorous, and bright, despite the twenty years of
work and poverty on which they had looked; that they became a
voice to Trotty Veck, and said: &lsquo;I think we have some
business here&mdash;a little!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes, and squeezed the
blooming face between his hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Pet,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
to do?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t expect you to-day, Meg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither did I expect to come, father,&rsquo; cried the
girl, nodding her head and smiling as she spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
here I am!&nbsp; And not alone; not alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why you don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rsquo; observed
Trotty, looking curiously at a covered basket which she carried
in her hand, &lsquo;that you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smell it, father dear,&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only smell it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty was going to lift up the cover at once, in a great
hurry, when she gaily interposed her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; said Meg, with the glee of a
child.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lengthen it out a little.&nbsp; Let me just
lift up the corner; just the lit-tle ti-ny cor-ner, you
know,&rsquo; said Meg, suiting the action to the word with the
utmost gentleness, and speaking very softly, as if she were
afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket;
&lsquo;there.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the
basket, and cried out in a rapture:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s hot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s burning hot!&rsquo; cried Meg.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s scalding hot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; roared Toby, with a sort of
kick.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s scalding hot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what is it, father?&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t guessed what it is.&nbsp;
And you must guess what it is.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of
taking it out, till you guess what it is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be in
such a hurry!&nbsp; Wait a minute!&nbsp; A little bit more of the
cover.&nbsp; Now guess!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too
soon; shrinking away, as she held the basket towards him; curling
up her pretty shoulders; stopping her ear with her hand, as if by
so doing she could keep the right word out of Toby&rsquo;s lips;
and laughing softly the whole time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Toby, putting a hand on each knee, bent down his
nose to the basket, and took a long inspiration at the lid; the
grin upon his withered face expanding in the process, as if he
were inhaling laughing gas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very nice,&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It an&rsquo;t&mdash;I suppose it an&rsquo;t
Polonies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; cried Meg, delighted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing like Polonies!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Toby, after another sniff.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s mellower than Polonies.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very nice.&nbsp; It improves every moment.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too decided for Trotters.&nbsp; An&rsquo;t
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg was in an ecstasy.&nbsp; He could not have gone wider of
the mark than Trotters&mdash;except Polonies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Liver?&rsquo; said Toby, communing with himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a mildness about it that
don&rsquo;t answer to liver.&nbsp; Pettitoes?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It
an&rsquo;t faint enough for pettitoes.&nbsp; It wants the
stringiness of Cocks&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; And I know it an&rsquo;t
sausages.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
chitterlings!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it an&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Meg, in a burst of
delight.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, it an&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what am I a-thinking of!&rsquo; said Toby,
suddenly recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it
was possible for him to assume.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall forget my
own name next.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s tripe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tripe it was; and Meg, in high joy, protested he should say,
in half a minute more, it was the best tripe ever stewed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so,&rsquo; said Meg, busying herself exultingly
with the basket, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay the cloth at once, father;
for I have brought the tripe in a basin, and tied the basin up in
a pocket-handkerchief; and if I like to be proud for once, and
spread that for a cloth, and call it a cloth, there&rsquo;s no
law to prevent me; is there, father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of, my dear,&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But they&rsquo;re always a-bringing up some new law or
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And according to what I was reading you in the paper
the other day, father; what the Judge said, you know; we poor
people are supposed to know them all.&nbsp; Ha ha!&nbsp; What a
mistake!&nbsp; My goodness me, how clever they think
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; cried Trotty; &lsquo;and
they&rsquo;d be very fond of any one of us that <i>did</i> know
&rsquo;em all.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d grow fat upon the work he&rsquo;d
get, that man, and be popular with the gentlefolks in his
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Very much so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d eat his dinner with an appetite, whoever he
was, if it smelt like this,&rsquo; said Meg, cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Make haste, for there&rsquo;s a hot potato besides, and
half a pint of fresh-drawn beer in a bottle.&nbsp; Where will you
dine, father?&nbsp; On the Post, or on the Steps?&nbsp; Dear,
dear, how grand we are.&nbsp; Two places to choose
from!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The steps to-day, my Pet,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Steps in dry weather.&nbsp; Post in wet.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a greater conveniency in the steps at all times,
because of the sitting down; but they&rsquo;re rheumatic in the
damp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then here,&rsquo; said Meg, clapping her hands, after a
moment&rsquo;s bustle; &lsquo;here it is, all ready!&nbsp; And
beautiful it looks!&nbsp; Come, father.&nbsp; Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since his discovery of the contents of the basket, Trotty had
been standing looking at her&mdash;and had been speaking
too&mdash;in an abstracted manner, which showed that though she
was the object of his thoughts and eyes, to the exclusion even of
tripe, he neither saw nor thought about her as she was at that
moment, but had before him some imaginary rough sketch or drama
of her future life.&nbsp; Roused, now, by her cheerful summons,
he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just coming
upon him, and trotted to her side.&nbsp; As he was stooping to
sit down, the Chimes rang.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; said Trotty, pulling off his hat and
looking up towards them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amen to the Bells, father?&rsquo; cried Meg.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They broke in like a grace, my dear,&rsquo; said
Trotty, taking his seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;d say a good
one, I am sure, if they could.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the kind thing
they say to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bells do, father!&rsquo; laughed Meg, as she set
the basin, and a knife and fork, before him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seem to, my Pet,&rsquo; said Trotty, falling to with
great vigour.&nbsp; &lsquo;And where&rsquo;s the
difference?&nbsp; If I hear &rsquo;em, what does it matter
whether they speak it or not?&nbsp; Why bless you, my
dear,&rsquo; said Toby, pointing at the tower with his fork, and
becoming more animated under the influence of dinner, &lsquo;how
often have I heard them bells say, &ldquo;Toby Veck, Toby Veck,
keep a good heart, Toby!&nbsp; Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good
heart, Toby!&rdquo;&nbsp; A million times?&nbsp; More!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo; cried Meg.</p>
<p>She had, though&mdash;over and over again.&nbsp; For it was
Toby&rsquo;s constant topic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When things is very bad,&rsquo; said Trotty;
&lsquo;very bad indeed, I mean; almost at the worst; then
it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon,
Toby!&nbsp; Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon,
Toby!&rdquo;&nbsp; That way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it comes&mdash;at last, father,&rsquo; said Meg,
with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always,&rsquo; answered the unconscious Toby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never fails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While this discourse was holding, Trotty made no pause in his
attack upon the savoury meat before him, but cut and ate, and cut
and drank, and cut and chewed, and dodged about, from tripe to
hot potato, and from hot potato back again to tripe, with an
unctuous and unflagging relish.&nbsp; But happening now to look
all round the street&mdash;in case anybody should be beckoning
from any door or window, for a porter&mdash;his eyes, in coming
back again, encountered Meg: sitting opposite to him, with her
arms folded and only busy in watching his progress with a smile
of happiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Lord forgive me!&rsquo; said Trotty, dropping his
knife and fork.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dove!&nbsp; Meg! why didn&rsquo;t
you tell me what a beast I was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sitting here,&rsquo; said Trotty, in penitent
explanation, &lsquo;cramming, and stuffing, and gorging myself;
and you before me there, never so much as breaking your precious
fast, nor wanting to, when&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have broken it, father,&rsquo; interposed his
daughter, laughing, &lsquo;all to bits.&nbsp; I have had my
dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two dinners
in one day!&nbsp; It an&rsquo;t possible!&nbsp; You might as well
tell me that two New Year&rsquo;s Days will come together, or
that I have had a gold head all my life, and never changed
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had my dinner, father, for all that,&rsquo; said
Meg, coming nearer to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if you&rsquo;ll go on
with yours, I&rsquo;ll tell you how and where; and how your
dinner came to be brought; and&mdash;and something else
besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby still appeared incredulous; but she looked into his face
with her clear eyes, and laying her hand upon his shoulder,
motioned him to go on while the meat was hot.&nbsp; So Trotty
took up his knife and fork again, and went to work.&nbsp; But
much more slowly than before, and shaking his head, as if he were
not at all pleased with himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had my dinner, father,&rsquo; said Meg, after a
little hesitation, &lsquo;with&mdash;with Richard.&nbsp; His
dinner-time was early; and as he brought his dinner with him when
he came to see me, we&mdash;we had it together,
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty took a little beer, and smacked his lips.&nbsp; Then he
said, &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;&mdash;because she waited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Richard says, father&mdash;&rsquo; Meg
resumed.&nbsp; Then stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does Richard say, Meg?&rsquo; asked Toby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard says, father&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Another
stoppage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard&rsquo;s a long time saying it,&rsquo; said
Toby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says then, father,&rsquo; Meg continued, lifting up
her eyes at last, and speaking in a tremble, but quite plainly;
&lsquo;another year is nearly gone, and where is the use of
waiting on from year to year, when it is so unlikely we shall
ever be better off than we are now?&nbsp; He says we are poor
now, father, and we shall be poor then, but we are young now, and
years will make us old before we know it.&nbsp; He says that if
we wait: people in our condition: until we see our way quite
clearly, the way will be a narrow one indeed&mdash;the common
way&mdash;the Grave, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A bolder man than Trotty Veck must needs have drawn upon his
boldness largely, to deny it.&nbsp; Trotty held his peace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how hard, father, to grow old, and die, and think
we might have cheered and helped each other!&nbsp; How hard in
all our lives to love each other; and to grieve, apart, to see
each other working, changing, growing old and grey.&nbsp; Even if
I got the better of it, and forgot him (which I never could), oh
father dear, how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now, and
live to have it slowly drained out every drop, without the
recollection of one happy moment of a woman&rsquo;s life, to stay
behind and comfort me, and make me better!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty sat quite still.&nbsp; Meg dried her eyes, and said
more gaily: that is to say, with here a laugh, and there a sob,
and here a laugh and sob together:</p>
<p>&lsquo;So Richard says, father; as his work was yesterday made
certain for some time to come, and as I love him, and have loved
him full three years&mdash;ah! longer than that, if he knew
it!&mdash;will I marry him on New Year&rsquo;s Day; the best and
happiest day, he says, in the whole year, and one that is almost
sure to bring good fortune with it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a short
notice, father&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;but I haven&rsquo;t my
fortune to be settled, or my wedding dresses to be made, like the
great ladies, father, have I?&nbsp; And he said so much, and said
it in his way; so strong and earnest, and all the time so kind
and gentle; that I said I&rsquo;d come and talk to you,
father.&nbsp; And as they paid the money for that work of mine
this morning (unexpectedly, I am sure!) and as you have fared
very poorly for a whole week, and as I couldn&rsquo;t help
wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of
holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me, father, I
made a little treat and brought it to surprise you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And see how he leaves it cooling on the step!&rsquo;
said another voice.</p>
<p>It was the voice of this same Richard, who had come upon them
unobserved, and stood before the father and daughter; looking
down upon them with a face as glowing as the iron on which his
stout sledge-hammer daily rung.&nbsp; A handsome, well-made,
powerful youngster he was; with eyes that sparkled like the
red-hot droppings from a furnace fire; black hair that curled
about his swarthy temples rarely; and a smile&mdash;a smile that
bore out Meg&rsquo;s eulogium on his style of conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See how he leaves it cooling on the step!&rsquo; said
Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Meg don&rsquo;t know what he likes.&nbsp;
Not she!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty, all action and enthusiasm, immediately reached up his
hand to Richard, and was going to address him in great hurry,
when the house-door opened without any warning, and a footman
very nearly put his foot into the tripe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the vays here, will you!&nbsp; You must always
go and be a-settin on our steps, must you!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
go and give a turn to none of the neighbours never, can&rsquo;t
you!&nbsp; <i>Will</i> you clear the road, or won&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the last question was irrelevant, as they
had already done it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, what&rsquo;s the
matter!&rsquo; said the gentleman for whom the door was opened;
coming out of the house at that kind of light-heavy
pace&mdash;that peculiar compromise between a walk and a
jog-trot&mdash;with which a gentleman upon the smooth down-hill
of life, wearing creaking boots, a watch-chain, and clean linen,
<i>may</i> come out of his house: not only without any abatement
of his dignity, but with an expression of having important and
wealthy engagements elsewhere.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re always a-being begged, and prayed, upon
your bended knees you are,&rsquo; said the footman with great
emphasis to Trotty Veck, &lsquo;to let our door-steps be.&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you let &rsquo;em be?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Can&rsquo;t</span> you let &rsquo;em be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll do, that&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo;
said the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloa there!&nbsp;
Porter!&rsquo; beckoning with his head to Trotty Veck.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come here.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Your
dinner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Trotty, leaving it behind him in
a corner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave it there,&rsquo; exclaimed the
gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bring it here, bring it here.&nbsp;
So!&nbsp; This is your dinner, is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; repeated Trotty, looking with a fixed
eye and a watery mouth, at the piece of tripe he had reserved for
a last delicious tit-bit; which the gentleman was now turning
over and over on the end of the fork.</p>
<p>Two other gentlemen had come out with him.&nbsp; One was a
low-spirited gentleman of middle age, of a meagre habit, and a
disconsolate face; who kept his hands continually in the pockets
of his scanty pepper-and-salt trousers, very large and
dog&rsquo;s-eared from that custom; and was not particularly well
brushed or washed.&nbsp; The other, a full-sized, sleek,
well-conditioned gentleman, in a blue coat with bright buttons,
and a white cravat.&nbsp; This gentleman had a very red face, as
if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up
into his head; which perhaps accounted for his having also the
appearance of being rather cold about the heart.</p>
<p>He who had Toby&rsquo;s meat upon the fork, called to the
first one by the name of Filer; and they both drew near
together.&nbsp; Mr. Filer being exceedingly short-sighted, was
obliged to go so close to the remnant of Toby&rsquo;s dinner
before he could make out what it was, that Toby&rsquo;s heart
leaped up into his mouth.&nbsp; But Mr. Filer didn&rsquo;t eat
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a description of animal food, Alderman,&rsquo;
said Filer, making little punches in it with a pencil-case,
&lsquo;commonly known to the labouring population of this
country, by the name of tripe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was a merry fellow,
Alderman Cute.&nbsp; Oh, and a sly fellow too!&nbsp; A knowing
fellow.&nbsp; Up to everything.&nbsp; Not to be imposed
upon.&nbsp; Deep in the people&rsquo;s hearts!&nbsp; He knew
them, Cute did.&nbsp; I believe you!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who eats tripe?&rsquo; said Mr. Filer, looking
round.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tripe is without an exception the least
economical, and the most wasteful article of consumption that the
markets of this country can by possibility produce.&nbsp; The
loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be, in the boiling,
seven-eights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any
other animal substance whatever.&nbsp; Tripe is more expensive,
properly understood, than the hothouse pine-apple.&nbsp; Taking
into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the
bills of mortality alone; and forming a low estimate of the
quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals, reasonably
well butchered, would yield; I find that the waste on that amount
of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men
for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February
over.&nbsp; The Waste, the Waste!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty stood aghast, and his legs shook under him.&nbsp; He
seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred men with his
own hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who eats tripe?&rsquo; said Mr. Filer, warmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who eats tripe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty made a miserable bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do, do you?&rsquo; said Mr. Filer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you something.&nbsp; You snatch your
tripe, my friend, out of the mouths of widows and
orphans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not, sir,&rsquo; said Trotty, faintly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d sooner die of want!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Divide the amount of tripe before-mentioned,
Alderman,&rsquo; said Mr. Filer, &lsquo;by the estimated number
of existing widows and orphans, and the result will be one
pennyweight of tripe to each.&nbsp; Not a grain is left for that
man.&nbsp; Consequently, he&rsquo;s a robber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty was so shocked, that it gave him no concern to see the
Alderman finish the tripe himself.&nbsp; It was a relief to get
rid of it, anyhow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you say?&rsquo; asked the Alderman,
jocosely, of the red-faced gentleman in the blue coat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have heard friend Filer.&nbsp; What do <i>you
say</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s it possible to say?&rsquo; returned the
gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;What <i>is</i> to be said?&nbsp; Who can
take any interest in a fellow like this,&rsquo; meaning Trotty;
&lsquo;in such degenerate times as these?&nbsp; Look at
him.&nbsp; What an object!&nbsp; The good old times, the grand
old times, the great old times!&nbsp; <i>Those</i> were the times
for a bold peasantry, and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; Those
were the times for every sort of thing, in fact.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothing now-a-days.&nbsp; Ah!&rsquo; sighed the
red-faced gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;The good old times, the good
old times!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman didn&rsquo;t specify what particular times he
alluded to; nor did he say whether he objected to the present
times, from a disinterested consciousness that they had done
nothing very remarkable in producing himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The good old times, the good old times,&rsquo; repeated
the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;What times they were!&nbsp; They were
the only times.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of no use talking about any
other times, or discussing what the people are in <i>these</i>
times.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t call these, times, do you?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Look into Strutt&rsquo;s Costumes, and see
what a Porter used to be, in any of the good old English
reigns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hadn&rsquo;t, in his very best circumstances, a
shirt to his back, or a stocking to his foot; and there was
scarcely a vegetable in all England for him to put into his
mouth,&rsquo; said Mr. Filer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can prove it, by
tables.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But still the red-faced gentleman extolled the good old times,
the grand old times, the great old times.&nbsp; No matter what
anybody else said, he still went turning round and round in one
set form of words concerning them; as a poor squirrel turns and
turns in its revolving cage; touching the mechanism, and trick of
which, it has probably quite as distinct perceptions, as ever
this red-faced gentleman had of his deceased Millennium.</p>
<p>It is possible that poor Trotty&rsquo;s faith in these very
vague Old Times was not entirely destroyed, for he felt vague
enough at that moment.&nbsp; One thing, however, was plain to
him, in the midst of his distress; to wit, that however these
gentlemen might differ in details, his misgivings of that
morning, and of many other mornings, were well founded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t go right or do right,&rsquo;
thought Trotty in despair.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no good in
us.&nbsp; We are born bad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Trotty had a father&rsquo;s heart within him; which had
somehow got into his breast in spite of this decree; and he could
not bear that Meg, in the blush of her brief joy, should have her
fortune read by these wise gentlemen.&nbsp; &lsquo;God help
her,&rsquo; thought poor Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;She will know it
soon enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He anxiously signed, therefore, to the young smith, to take
her away.&nbsp; But he was so busy, talking to her softly at a
little distance, that he only became conscious of this desire,
simultaneously with Alderman Cute.&nbsp; Now, the Alderman had
not yet had his say, but <i>he</i> was a philosopher,
too&mdash;practical, though!&nbsp; Oh, very practical&mdash;and,
as he had no idea of losing any portion of his audience, he cried
&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you know,&rsquo; said the Alderman, addressing his
two friends, with a self-complacent smile upon his face which was
habitual to him, &lsquo;I am a plain man, and a practical man;
and I go to work in a plain practical way.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
way.&nbsp; There is not the least mystery or difficulty in
dealing with this sort of people if you only understand
&rsquo;em, and can talk to &rsquo;em in their own manner.&nbsp;
Now, you Porter!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you ever tell me, or anybody
else, my friend, that you haven&rsquo;t always enough to eat, and
of the best; because I know better.&nbsp; I have tasted your
tripe, you know, and you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;
me.&nbsp; You understand what &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; means,
eh?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the right word, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Ha,
ha, ha! Lord bless you,&rsquo; said the Alderman, turning to his
friends again, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the easiest thing on earth to
deal with this sort of people, if you understand
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Famous man for the common people, Alderman Cute!&nbsp; Never
out of temper with them!&nbsp; Easy, affable, joking, knowing
gentleman!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, my friend,&rsquo; pursued the Alderman,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a great deal of nonsense talked about
Want&mdash;&ldquo;hard up,&rdquo; you know; that&rsquo;s the
phrase, isn&rsquo;t it? ha! ha! ha!&mdash;and I intend to Put it
Down.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a certain amount of cant in vogue about
Starvation, and I mean to Put it Down.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all!&nbsp; Lord bless you,&rsquo; said the Alderman, turning to
his friends again, &lsquo;you may Put Down anything among this
sort of people, if you only know the way to set about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty took Meg&rsquo;s hand and drew it through his
arm.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to know what he was doing
though.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your daughter, eh?&rsquo; said the Alderman, chucking
her familiarly under the chin.</p>
<p>Always affable with the working classes, Alderman Cute!&nbsp;
Knew what pleased them!&nbsp; Not a bit of pride!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s her mother?&rsquo; asked that worthy
gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead,&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her mother got up
linen; and was called to Heaven when She was born.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to get up linen <i>there</i>, I suppose,&rsquo;
remarked the Alderman pleasantly.</p>
<p>Toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in
Heaven from her old pursuits.&nbsp; But query: If Mrs. Alderman
Cute had gone to Heaven, would Mr. Alderman Cute have pictured
her as holding any state or station there?</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;re making love to her, are you?&rsquo;
said Cute to the young smith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned Richard quickly, for he was
nettled by the question.&nbsp; &lsquo;And we are going to be
married on New Year&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean!&rsquo; cried Filer sharply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Married!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes, we&rsquo;re thinking of it, Master,&rsquo;
said Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re rather in a hurry, you
see, in case it should be Put Down first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Filer, with a groan.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put
<i>that</i> down indeed, Alderman, and you&rsquo;ll do
something.&nbsp; Married!&nbsp; Married!!&nbsp; The ignorance of
the first principles of political economy on the part of these
people; their improvidence; their wickedness; is, by Heavens!
enough to&mdash;Now look at that couple, will you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well?&nbsp; They were worth looking at.&nbsp; And marriage
seemed as reasonable and fair a deed as they need have in
contemplation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man may live to be as old as Methuselah,&rsquo; said
Mr. Filer, &lsquo;and may labour all his life for the benefit of
such people as those; and may heap up facts on figures, facts on
figures, facts on figures, mountains high and dry; and he can no
more hope to persuade &rsquo;em that they have no right or
business to be married, than he can hope to persuade &rsquo;em
that they have no earthly right or business to be born.&nbsp; And
<i>that</i> we know they haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We reduced it to a
mathematical certainty long ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alderman Cute was mightily diverted, and laid his right
forefinger on the side of his nose, as much as to say to both his
friends, &lsquo;Observe me, will you!&nbsp; Keep your eye on the
practical man!&rsquo;&mdash;and called Meg to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here, my girl!&rsquo; said Alderman Cute.</p>
<p>The young blood of her lover had been mounting, wrathfully,
within the last few minutes; and he was indisposed to let her
come.&nbsp; But, setting a constraint upon himself, he came
forward with a stride as Meg approached, and stood beside
her.&nbsp; Trotty kept her hand within his arm still, but looked
from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to give you a word or two of good
advice, my girl,&rsquo; said the Alderman, in his nice easy
way.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my place to give advice, you know,
because I&rsquo;m a Justice.&nbsp; You know I&rsquo;m a Justice,
don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg timidly said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; But everybody knew
Alderman Cute was a Justice!&nbsp; Oh dear, so active a Justice
always!&nbsp; Who such a mote of brightness in the public eye, as
Cute!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to be married, you say,&rsquo; pursued
the Alderman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very unbecoming and indelicate in one
of your sex!&nbsp; But never mind that.&nbsp; After you are
married, you&rsquo;ll quarrel with your husband and come to be a
distressed wife.&nbsp; You may think not; but you will, because I
tell you so.&nbsp; Now, I give you fair warning, that I have made
up my mind to Put distressed wives Down.&nbsp; So, don&rsquo;t be
brought before me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have
children&mdash;boys.&nbsp; Those boys will grow up bad, of
course, and run wild in the streets, without shoes and
stockings.&nbsp; Mind, my young friend!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll convict
&rsquo;em summarily, every one, for I am determined to Put boys
without shoes and stockings, Down.&nbsp; Perhaps your husband
will die young (most likely) and leave you with a baby.&nbsp;
Then you&rsquo;ll be turned out of doors, and wander up and down
the streets.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t wander near me, my dear, for
I am resolved, to Put all wandering mothers Down.&nbsp; All young
mothers, of all sorts and kinds, it&rsquo;s my determination to
Put Down.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think to plead illness as an excuse
with me; or babies as an excuse with me; for all sick persons and
young children (I hope you know the church-service, but I&rsquo;m
afraid not) I am determined to Put Down.&nbsp; And if you
attempt, desperately, and ungratefully, and impiously, and
fraudulently attempt, to drown yourself, or hang yourself,
I&rsquo;ll have no pity for you, for I have made up my mind to
Put all suicide Down!&nbsp; If there is one thing,&rsquo; said
the Alderman, with his self-satisfied smile, &lsquo;on which I
can be said to have made up my mind more than on another, it is
to Put suicide Down.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t try it on.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the phrase, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Ha, ha! now we
understand each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad, to see that Meg
had turned a deadly white, and dropped her lover&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And as for you, you dull dog,&rsquo; said the Alderman,
turning with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the
young smith, &lsquo;what are you thinking of being married
for?&nbsp; What do you want to be married for, you silly
fellow?&nbsp; If I was a fine, young, strapping chap like you, I
should be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a
woman&rsquo;s apron-strings!&nbsp; Why, she&rsquo;ll be an old
woman before you&rsquo;re a middle-aged man!&nbsp; And a pretty
figure you&rsquo;ll cut then, with a draggle-tailed wife and a
crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>O, he knew how to banter the common people, Alderman Cute!</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; Go along with you,&rsquo; said the
Alderman, &lsquo;and repent.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make such a fool
of yourself as to get married on New Year&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll think very differently of it, long before next New
Year&rsquo;s Day: a trim young fellow like you, with all the
girls looking after you.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Go along with
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went along.&nbsp; Not arm in arm, or hand in hand, or
interchanging bright glances; but, she in tears; he, gloomy and
down-looking.&nbsp; Were these the hearts that had so lately made
old Toby&rsquo;s leap up from its faintness?&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp;
The Alderman (a blessing on his head!) had Put <i>them</i>
Down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you happen to be here,&rsquo; said the Alderman to
Toby, &lsquo;you shall carry a letter for me.&nbsp; Can you be
quick?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re an old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby, who had been looking after Meg, quite stupidly, made
shift to murmur out that he was very quick, and very strong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old are you?&rsquo; inquired the Alderman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m over sixty, sir,&rsquo; said Toby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s a great deal past the average
age, you know,&rsquo; cried Mr. Filer breaking in as if his
patience would bear some trying, but this really was carrying
matters a little too far.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel I&rsquo;m intruding, sir,&rsquo; said
Toby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I misdoubted it this morning.&nbsp; Oh
dear me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his
pocket.&nbsp; Toby would have got a shilling too; but Mr. Filer
clearly showing that in that case he would rob a certain given
number of persons of ninepence-halfpenny a-piece, he only got
sixpence; and thought himself very well off to get that.</p>
<p>Then the Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends, and
walked off in high feather; but, he immediately came hurrying
back alone, as if he had forgotten something.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Porter!&rsquo; said the Alderman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; said Toby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care of that daughter of yours.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
much too handsome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other,
I suppose,&rsquo; thought Toby, looking at the sixpence in his
hand, and thinking of the tripe.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s been
and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a-piece, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
dreadful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s much too handsome, my man,&rsquo; repeated
the Alderman.&nbsp; &lsquo;The chances are, that she&rsquo;ll
come to no good, I clearly see.&nbsp; Observe what I say.&nbsp;
Take care of her!&rsquo;&nbsp; With which, he hurried off
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wrong every way.&nbsp; Wrong every way!&rsquo; said
Trotty, clasping his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Born bad.&nbsp; No
business here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the
words.&nbsp; Full, loud, and sounding&mdash;but with no
encouragement.&nbsp; No, not a drop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The tune&rsquo;s changed,&rsquo; cried the old man, as
he listened.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a word of all that
fancy in it.&nbsp; Why should there be?&nbsp; I have no business
with the New Year nor with the old one neither.&nbsp; Let me
die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still the Bells, pealing forth their changes, made the very
air spin.&nbsp; Put &rsquo;em down, Put &rsquo;em down!&nbsp;
Good old Times, Good old Times!&nbsp; Facts and Figures, Facts
and Figures!&nbsp; Put &rsquo;em down, Put &rsquo;em down!&nbsp;
If they said anything they said this, until the brain of Toby
reeled.</p>
<p>He pressed his bewildered head between his hands, as if to
keep it from splitting asunder.&nbsp; A well-timed action, as it
happened; for finding the letter in one of them, and being by
that means reminded of his charge, he fell, mechanically, into
his usual trot, and trotted off.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;The Second Quarter.</h2>
<p>The letter Toby had received from Alderman Cute, was addressed
to a great man in the great district of the town.&nbsp; The
greatest district of the town.&nbsp; It must have been the
greatest district of the town, because it was commonly called
&lsquo;the world&rsquo; by its inhabitants.&nbsp; The letter
positively seemed heavier in Toby&rsquo;s hand, than another
letter.&nbsp; Not because the Alderman had sealed it with a very
large coat of arms and no end of wax, but because of the weighty
name on the superscription, and the ponderous amount of gold and
silver with which it was associated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How different from us!&rsquo; thought Toby, in all
simplicity and earnestness, as he looked at the direction.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Divide the lively turtles in the bills of mortality, by
the number of gentlefolks able to buy &rsquo;em; and whose share
does he take but his own!&nbsp; As to snatching tripe from
anybody&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;he&rsquo;d scorn it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the involuntary homage due to such an exalted character,
Toby interposed a corner of his apron between the letter and his
fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His children,&rsquo; said Trotty, and a mist rose
before his eyes; &lsquo;his daughters&mdash;Gentlemen may win
their hearts and marry them; they may be happy wives and mothers;
they may be handsome like my darling M-e-&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t finish the name.&nbsp; The final letter
swelled in his throat, to the size of the whole alphabet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; thought Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know
what I mean.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s more than enough for
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with this consolatory rumination, trotted
on.</p>
<p>It was a hard frost, that day.&nbsp; The air was bracing,
crisp, and clear.&nbsp; The wintry sun, though powerless for
warmth, looked brightly down upon the ice it was too weak to
melt, and set a radiant glory there.&nbsp; At other times, Trotty
might have learned a poor man&rsquo;s lesson from the wintry sun;
but, he was past that, now.</p>
<p>The Year was Old, that day.&nbsp; The patient Year had lived
through the reproaches and misuses of its slanderers, and
faithfully performed its work.&nbsp; Spring, summer, autumn,
winter.&nbsp; It had laboured through the destined round, and now
laid down its weary head to die.&nbsp; Shut out from hope, high
impulse, active happiness, itself, but active messenger of many
joys to others, it made appeal in its decline to have its toiling
days and patient hours remembered, and to die in peace.&nbsp;
Trotty might have read a poor man&rsquo;s allegory in the fading
year; but he was past that, now.</p>
<p>And only he?&nbsp; Or has the like appeal been ever made, by
seventy years at once upon an English labourer&rsquo;s head, and
made in vain!</p>
<p>The streets were full of motion, and the shops were decked out
gaily.&nbsp; The New Year, like an Infant Heir to the whole
world, was waited for, with welcomes, presents, and
rejoicings.&nbsp; There were books and toys for the New Year,
glittering trinkets for the New Year, dresses for the New Year,
schemes of fortune for the New Year; new inventions to beguile
it.&nbsp; Its life was parcelled out in almanacks and
pocket-books; the coming of its moons, and stars, and tides, was
known beforehand to the moment; all the workings of its seasons
in their days and nights, were calculated with as much precision
as Mr. Filer could work sums in men and women.</p>
<p>The New Year, the New Year.&nbsp; Everywhere the New
Year!&nbsp; The Old Year was already looked upon as dead; and its
effects were selling cheap, like some drowned mariner&rsquo;s
aboardship.&nbsp; Its patterns were Last Year&rsquo;s, and going
at a sacrifice, before its breath was gone.&nbsp; Its treasures
were mere dirt, beside the riches of its unborn successor!</p>
<p>Trotty had no portion, to his thinking, in the New Year or the
Old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put &rsquo;em down, Put &rsquo;em down!&nbsp; Facts and
Figures, Facts and Figures!&nbsp; Good old Times, Good old
Times!&nbsp; Put &rsquo;em down, Put &rsquo;em
down!&rsquo;&mdash;his trot went to that measure, and would fit
itself to nothing else.</p>
<p>But, even that one, melancholy as it was, brought him, in due
time, to the end of his journey.&nbsp; To the mansion of Sir
Joseph Bowley, Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>The door was opened by a Porter.&nbsp; Such a Porter!&nbsp;
Not of Toby&rsquo;s order.&nbsp; Quite another thing.&nbsp; His
place was the ticket though; not Toby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This Porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak;
having breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair,
without first taking time to think about it and compose his
mind.&nbsp; When he had found his voice&mdash;which it took him a
long time to do, for it was a long way off, and hidden under a
load of meat&mdash;he said in a fat whisper,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s it from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby told him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re to take it in, yourself,&rsquo; said the
Porter, pointing to a room at the end of a long passage, opening
from the hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything goes straight in, on this
day of the year.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not a bit too soon; for the
carriage is at the door now, and they have only come to town for
a couple of hours, a&rsquo; purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby wiped his feet (which were quite dry already) with great
care, and took the way pointed out to him; observing as he went
that it was an awfully grand house, but hushed and covered up, as
if the family were in the country.&nbsp; Knocking at the
room-door, he was told to enter from within; and doing so found
himself in a spacious library, where, at a table strewn with
files and papers, were a stately lady in a bonnet; and a not very
stately gentleman in black who wrote from her dictation; while
another, and an older, and a much statelier gentleman, whose hat
and cane were on the table, walked up and down, with one hand in
his breast, and looked complacently from time to time at his own
picture&mdash;a full length; a very full length&mdash;hanging
over the fireplace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; said the last-named
gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Fish, will you have the goodness to
attend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fish begged pardon, and taking the letter from Toby,
handed it, with great respect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Alderman Cute, Sir Joseph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this all?&nbsp; Have you nothing else,
Porter?&rsquo; inquired Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>Toby replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no bill or demand upon me&mdash;my name is
Bowley, Sir Joseph Bowley&mdash;of any kind from anybody, have
you?&rsquo; said Sir Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have, present
it.&nbsp; There is a cheque-book by the side of Mr. Fish.&nbsp; I
allow nothing to be carried into the New Year.&nbsp; Every
description of account is settled in this house at the close of
the old one.&nbsp; So that if death was
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To cut,&rsquo; suggested Mr. Fish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To sever, sir,&rsquo; returned Sir Joseph, with great
asperity, &lsquo;the cord of existence&mdash;my affairs would be
found, I hope, in a state of preparation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Sir Joseph!&rsquo; said the lady, who was
greatly younger than the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
shocking!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady Bowley,&rsquo; returned Sir Joseph, floundering
now and then, as in the great depth of his observations,
&lsquo;at this season of the year we should think
of&mdash;of&mdash;ourselves.&nbsp; We should look into
our&mdash;our accounts.&nbsp; We should feel that every return of
so eventful a period in human transactions, involves a matter of
deep moment between a man and his&mdash;and his
banker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full
morality of what he was saying; and desired that even Trotty
should have an opportunity of being improved by such
discourse.&nbsp; Possibly he had this end before him in still
forbearing to break the seal of the letter, and in telling Trotty
to wait where he was, a minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were desiring Mr. Fish to say, my
lady&mdash;&rsquo; observed Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Fish has said that, I believe,&rsquo; returned his
lady, glancing at the letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, upon my word, Sir
Joseph, I don&rsquo;t think I can let it go after all.&nbsp; It
is so very dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is dear?&rsquo; inquired Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Charity, my love.&nbsp; They only allow two votes
for a subscription of five pounds.&nbsp; Really
monstrous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady Bowley,&rsquo; returned Sir Joseph, &lsquo;you
surprise me.&nbsp; Is the luxury of feeling in proportion to the
number of votes; or is it, to a rightly constituted mind, in
proportion to the number of applicants, and the wholesome state
of mind to which their canvassing reduces them?&nbsp; Is there no
excitement of the purest kind in having two votes to dispose of
among fifty people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to me, I acknowledge,&rsquo; replied the
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;It bores one.&nbsp; Besides, one can&rsquo;t
oblige one&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; But you are the Poor
Man&rsquo;s Friend, you know, Sir Joseph.&nbsp; You think
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>am</i> the Poor Man&rsquo;s Friend,&rsquo;
observed Sir Joseph, glancing at the poor man present.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As such I may be taunted.&nbsp; As such I have been
taunted.&nbsp; But I ask no other title.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless him for a noble gentleman!&rsquo; thought
Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with Cute here, for
instance,&rsquo; said Sir Joseph, holding out the letter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with the Filer party.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t agree with any party.&nbsp; My friend the Poor Man,
has no business with anything of that sort, and nothing of that
sort has any business with him.&nbsp; My friend the Poor Man, in
my district, is my business.&nbsp; No man or body of men has any
right to interfere between my friend and me.&nbsp; That is the
ground I take.&nbsp; I assume a&mdash;a paternal character
towards my friend.&nbsp; I say, &ldquo;My good fellow, I will
treat you paternally.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby listened with great gravity, and began to feel more
comfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your only business, my good fellow,&rsquo; pursued Sir
Joseph, looking abstractedly at Toby; &lsquo;your only business
in life is with me.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to
think about anything.&nbsp; I will think for you; I know what is
good for you; I am your perpetual parent.&nbsp; Such is the
dispensation of an all-wise Providence!&nbsp; Now, the design of
your creation is&mdash;not that you should swill, and guzzle, and
associate your enjoyments, brutally, with food; Toby thought
remorsefully of the tripe; &lsquo;but that you should feel the
Dignity of Labour.&nbsp; Go forth erect into the cheerful morning
air, and&mdash;and stop there.&nbsp; Live hard and temperately,
be respectful, exercise your self-denial, bring up your family on
next to nothing, pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes,
be punctual in your dealings (I set you a good example; you will
find Mr. Fish, my confidential secretary, with a cash-box before
him at all times); and you may trust to me to be your Friend and
Father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice children, indeed, Sir Joseph!&rsquo; said the
lady, with a shudder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rheumatisms, and fevers, and
crooked legs, and asthmas, and all kinds of horrors!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady,&rsquo; returned Sir Joseph, with solemnity,
&lsquo;not the less am I the Poor Man&rsquo;s Friend and
Father.&nbsp; Not the less shall he receive encouragement at my
hands.&nbsp; Every quarter-day he will be put in communication
with Mr. Fish.&nbsp; Every New Year&rsquo;s Day, myself and
friends will drink his health.&nbsp; Once every year, myself and
friends will address him with the deepest feeling.&nbsp; Once in
his life, he may even perhaps receive; in public, in the presence
of the gentry; a Trifle from a Friend.&nbsp; And when, upheld no
more by these stimulants, and the Dignity of Labour, he sinks
into his comfortable grave, then, my lady&rsquo;&mdash;here Sir
Joseph blew his nose&mdash;&lsquo;I will be a Friend and a
Father&mdash;on the same terms&mdash;to his children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby was greatly moved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! You have a thankful family, Sir Joseph!&rsquo; cried
his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady,&rsquo; said Sir Joseph, quite majestically,
&lsquo;Ingratitude is known to be the sin of that class.&nbsp; I
expect no other return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Born bad!&rsquo; thought Toby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing melts us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What man can do, <i>I</i> do,&rsquo; pursued Sir
Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do my duty as the Poor Man&rsquo;s Friend
and Father; and I endeavour to educate his mind, by inculcating
on all occasions the one great moral lesson which that class
requires.&nbsp; That is, entire Dependence on myself.&nbsp; They
have no business whatever with&mdash;with themselves.&nbsp; If
wicked and designing persons tell them otherwise, and they become
impatient and discontented, and are guilty of insubordinate
conduct and black-hearted ingratitude; which is undoubtedly the
case; I am their Friend and Father still.&nbsp; It is so
Ordained.&nbsp; It is in the nature of things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that great sentiment, he opened the Alderman&rsquo;s
letter; and read it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very polite and attentive, I am sure!&rsquo; exclaimed
Sir Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;My lady, the Alderman is so obliging as
to remind me that he has had &ldquo;the distinguished
honour&rdquo;&mdash;he is very good&mdash;of meeting me at the
house of our mutual friend Deedles, the banker; and he does me
the favour to inquire whether it will be agreeable to me to have
Will Fern put down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Most</i> agreeable!&rsquo; replied my Lady
Bowley.&nbsp; &lsquo;The worst man among them!&nbsp; He has been
committing a robbery, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why no,&rsquo; said Sir Joseph&rsquo;, referring to the
letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not quite.&nbsp; Very near.&nbsp; Not
quite.&nbsp; He came up to London, it seems, to look for
employment (trying to better himself&mdash;that&rsquo;s his
story), and being found at night asleep in a shed, was taken into
custody, and carried next morning before the Alderman.&nbsp; The
Alderman observes (very properly) that he is determined to put
this sort of thing down; and that if it will be agreeable to me
to have Will Fern put down, he will be happy to begin with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let him be made an example of, by all means,&rsquo;
returned the lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Last winter, when I introduced
pinking and eyelet-holing among the men and boys in the village,
as a nice evening employment, and had the lines,</p>
<blockquote><p>O let us love our occupations,<br />
Bless the squire and his relations,<br />
Live upon our daily rations,<br />
And always know our proper stations,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>set to music on the new system, for them to sing the while;
this very Fern&mdash;I see him now&mdash;touched that hat of his,
and said, &ldquo;I humbly ask your pardon, my lady, but
<i>an&rsquo;t</i> I something different from a great
girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; I expected it, of course; who can expect
anything but insolence and ingratitude from that class of
people!&nbsp; That is not to the purpose, however.&nbsp; Sir
Joseph!&nbsp; Make an example of him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; coughed Sir Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Fish,
if you&rsquo;ll have the goodness to attend&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fish immediately seized his pen, and wrote from Sir
Joseph&rsquo;s dictation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Private.&nbsp; My dear Sir.&nbsp; I am very much
indebted to you for your courtesy in the matter of the man
William Fern, of whom, I regret to add, I can say nothing
favourable.&nbsp; I have uniformly considered myself in the light
of his Friend and Father, but have been repaid (a common case, I
grieve to say) with ingratitude, and constant opposition to my
plans.&nbsp; He is a turbulent and rebellious spirit.&nbsp; His
character will not bear investigation.&nbsp; Nothing will
persuade him to be happy when he might.&nbsp; Under these
circumstances, it appears to me, I own, that when he comes before
you again (as you informed me he promised to do to-morrow,
pending your inquiries, and I think he may be so far relied
upon), his committal for some short term as a Vagabond, would be
a service to society, and would be a salutary example in a
country where&mdash;for the sake of those who are, through good
and evil report, the Friends and Fathers of the Poor, as well as
with a view to that, generally speaking, misguided class
themselves&mdash;examples are greatly needed.&nbsp; And I
am,&rsquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It appears,&rsquo; remarked Sir Joseph when he had
signed this letter, and Mr. Fish was sealing it, &lsquo;as if
this were Ordained: really.&nbsp; At the close of the year, I
wind up my account and strike my balance, even with William
Fern!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty, who had long ago relapsed, and was very low-spirited,
stepped forward with a rueful face to take the letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With my compliments and thanks,&rsquo; said Sir
Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Fish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard, perhaps,&rsquo; said Sir Joseph,
oracularly, &lsquo;certain remarks into which I have been led
respecting the solemn period of time at which we have arrived,
and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs, and being
prepared.&nbsp; You have observed that I don&rsquo;t shelter
myself behind my superior standing in society, but that Mr.
Fish&mdash;that gentleman&mdash;has a cheque-book at his elbow,
and is in fact here, to enable me to turn over a perfectly new
leaf, and enter on the epoch before us with a clean
account.&nbsp; Now, my friend, can you lay your hand upon your
heart, and say, that you also have made preparations for a New
Year?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid, sir,&rsquo; stammered Trotty, looking
meekly at him, &lsquo;that I am a&mdash;a&mdash;little
behind-hand with the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behind-hand with the world!&rsquo; repeated Sir Joseph
Bowley, in a tone of terrible distinctness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid, sir,&rsquo; faltered Trotty, &lsquo;that
there&rsquo;s a matter of ten or twelve shillings owing to Mrs.
Chickenstalker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Mrs. Chickenstalker!&rsquo; repeated Sir Joseph, in
the same tone as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shop, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Toby, &lsquo;in the
general line.&nbsp; Also a&mdash;a little money on account of
rent.&nbsp; A very little, sir.&nbsp; It oughtn&rsquo;t to be
owing, I know, but we have been hard put to it,
indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Joseph looked at his lady, and at Mr. Fish, and at Trotty,
one after another, twice all round.&nbsp; He then made a
despondent gesture with both hands at once, as if he gave the
thing up altogether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How a man, even among this improvident and
impracticable race; an old man; a man grown grey; can look a New
Year in the face, with his affairs in this condition; how he can
lie down on his bed at night, and get up again in the morning,
and&mdash;There!&rsquo; he said, turning his back on
Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take the letter.&nbsp; Take the
letter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heartily wish it was otherwise, sir,&rsquo; said
Trotty, anxious to excuse himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been
tried very hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Joseph still repeating &lsquo;Take the letter, take the
letter!&rsquo; and Mr. Fish not only saying the same thing, but
giving additional force to the request by motioning the bearer to
the door, he had nothing for it but to make his bow and leave the
house.&nbsp; And in the street, poor Trotty pulled his worn old
hat down on his head, to hide the grief he felt at getting no
hold on the New Year, anywhere.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even lift his hat to look up at the Bell tower
when he came to the old church on his return.&nbsp; He halted
there a moment, from habit: and knew that it was growing dark,
and that the steeple rose above him, indistinct and faint, in the
murky air.&nbsp; He knew, too, that the Chimes would ring
immediately; and that they sounded to his fancy, at such a time,
like voices in the clouds.&nbsp; But he only made the more haste
to deliver the Alderman&rsquo;s letter, and get out of the way
before they began; for he dreaded to hear them tagging
&lsquo;Friends and Fathers, Friends and Fathers,&rsquo; to the
burden they had rung out last.</p>
<p>Toby discharged himself of his commission, therefore, with all
possible speed, and set off trotting homeward.&nbsp; But what
with his pace, which was at best an awkward one in the street;
and what with his hat, which didn&rsquo;t improve it; he trotted
against somebody in less than no time, and was sent staggering
out into the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo; said Trotty,
pulling up his hat in great confusion, and between the hat and
the torn lining, fixing his head into a kind of bee-hive.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t hurt you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to hurting anybody, Toby was not such an absolute Samson,
but that he was much more likely to be hurt himself: and indeed,
he had flown out into the road, like a shuttlecock.&nbsp; He had
such an opinion of his own strength, however, that he was in real
concern for the other party: and said again,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t hurt you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man against whom he had run; a sun-browned, sinewy,
country-looking man, with grizzled hair, and a rough chin; stared
at him for a moment, as if he suspected him to be in jest.&nbsp;
But, satisfied of his good faith, he answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, friend.&nbsp; You have not hurt me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor the child, I hope?&rsquo; said Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor the child,&rsquo; returned the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
thank you kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he said so, he glanced at a little girl he carried in his
arms, asleep: and shading her face with the long end of the poor
handkerchief he wore about his throat, went slowly on.</p>
<p>The tone in which he said &lsquo;I thank you kindly,&rsquo;
penetrated Trotty&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; He was so jaded and
foot-sore, and so soiled with travel, and looked about him so
forlorn and strange, that it was a comfort to him to be able to
thank any one: no matter for how little.&nbsp; Toby stood gazing
after him as he plodded wearily away, with the child&rsquo;s arm
clinging round his neck.</p>
<p>At the figure in the worn shoes&mdash;now the very shade and
ghost of shoes&mdash;rough leather leggings, common frock, and
broad slouched hat, Trotty stood gazing, blind to the whole
street.&nbsp; And at the child&rsquo;s arm, clinging round its
neck.</p>
<p>Before he merged into the darkness the traveller stopped; and
looking round, and seeing Trotty standing there yet, seemed
undecided whether to return or go on.&nbsp; After doing first the
one and then the other, he came back, and Trotty went half-way to
meet him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can tell me, perhaps,&rsquo; said the man with a
faint smile, &lsquo;and if you can I am sure you will, and
I&rsquo;d rather ask you than another&mdash;where Alderman Cute
lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Close at hand,&rsquo; replied Toby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you his house with pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was to have gone to him elsewhere to-morrow,&rsquo;
said the man, accompanying Toby, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m uneasy
under suspicion, and want to clear myself, and to be free to go
and seek my bread&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where.&nbsp; So, maybe
he&rsquo;ll forgive my going to his house to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; cried Toby with a start,
&lsquo;that your name&rsquo;s Fern!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; cried the other, turning on him in
astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fern!&nbsp; Will Fern!&rsquo; said Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rsquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said Trotty, seizing him by the arm,
and looking cautiously round, &lsquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t go to him!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go to him!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll put you down as sure as ever you were born.&nbsp;
Here! come up this alley, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
mean.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go to <i>him</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad; but he
bore him company nevertheless.&nbsp; When they were shrouded from
observation, Trotty told him what he knew, and what character he
had received, and all about it.</p>
<p>The subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that
surprised him.&nbsp; He did not contradict or interrupt it,
once.&nbsp; He nodded his head now and then&mdash;more in
corroboration of an old and worn-out story, it appeared, than in
refutation of it; and once or twice threw back his hat, and
passed his freckled hand over a brow, where every furrow he had
ploughed seemed to have set its image in little.&nbsp; But he did
no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true enough in the main,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;master, I could sift grain from husk here and there, but
let it be as &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; What odds?&nbsp; I have gone
against his plans; to my misfortun&rsquo;.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help it; I should do the like to-morrow.&nbsp; As to character,
them gentlefolks will search and search, and pry and pry, and
have it as free from spot or speck in us, afore they&rsquo;ll
help us to a dry good word!&mdash;Well! I hope they don&rsquo;t
lose good opinion as easy as we do, or their lives is strict
indeed, and hardly worth the keeping.&nbsp; For myself, master, I
never took with that hand&rsquo;&mdash;holding it before
him&mdash;&lsquo;what wasn&rsquo;t my own; and never held it back
from work, however hard, or poorly paid.&nbsp; Whoever can deny
it, let him chop it off!&nbsp; But when work won&rsquo;t maintain
me like a human creetur; when my living is so bad, that I am
Hungry, out of doors and in; when I see a whole working life
begin that way, go on that way, and end that way, without a
chance or change; then I say to the gentlefolks &ldquo;Keep away
from me!&nbsp; Let my cottage be.&nbsp; My doors is dark enough
without your darkening of &rsquo;em more.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look
for me to come up into the Park to help the show when
there&rsquo;s a Birthday, or a fine Speechmaking, or what
not.&nbsp; Act your Plays and Games without me, and be welcome to
&rsquo;em, and enjoy &rsquo;em.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve nowt to do with
one another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m best let alone!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes, and was
looking about her in wonder, he checked himself to say a word or
two of foolish prattle in her ear, and stand her on the ground
beside him.&nbsp; Then slowly winding one of her long tresses
round and round his rough forefinger like a ring, while she hung
about his dusty leg, he said to Trotty:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a cross-grained man by natu&rsquo;, I
believe; and easy satisfied, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I bear no
ill-will against none of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I only want to live
like one of the Almighty&rsquo;s creeturs.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;and so there&rsquo;s a pit
dug between me, and them that can and do.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
others like me.&nbsp; You might tell &rsquo;em off by hundreds
and by thousands, sooner than by ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty knew he spoke the Truth in this, and shook his head to
signify as much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bad name this way,&rsquo; said Fern;
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m not likely, I&rsquo;m afeared, to get a
better.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tan&rsquo;t lawful to be out of sorts, and I
<span class="smcap">am</span> out of sorts, though God knows
I&rsquo;d sooner bear a cheerful spirit if I could.&nbsp;
Well!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as this Alderman could hurt
<i>me</i> much by sending me to jail; but without a friend to
speak a word for me, he might do it; and you see&mdash;!&rsquo;
pointing downward with his finger, at the child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has a beautiful face,&rsquo; said Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why yes!&rsquo; replied the other in a low voice, as he
gently turned it up with both his hands towards his own, and
looked upon it steadfastly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought so,
many times.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve thought so, when my hearth was very
cold, and cupboard very bare.&nbsp; I thought so t&rsquo;other
night, when we were taken like two thieves.&nbsp; But
they&mdash;they shouldn&rsquo;t try the little face too often,
should they, Lilian?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s hardly fair upon a
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sunk his voice so low, and gazed upon her with an air so
stern and strange, that Toby, to divert the current of his
thoughts, inquired if his wife were living.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never had one,&rsquo; he returned, shaking his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s child: a
orphan.&nbsp; Nine year old, though you&rsquo;d hardly think it;
but she&rsquo;s tired and worn out now.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have
taken care on her, the Union&mdash;eight-and-twenty mile away
from where we live&mdash;between four walls (as they took care of
my old father when he couldn&rsquo;t work no more, though he
didn&rsquo;t trouble &rsquo;em long); but I took her instead, and
she&rsquo;s lived with me ever since.&nbsp; Her mother had a
friend once, in London here.&nbsp; We are trying to find her, and
to find work too; but it&rsquo;s a large place.&nbsp; Never
mind.&nbsp; More room for us to walk about in, Lilly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meeting the child&rsquo;s eyes with a smile which melted Toby
more than tears, he shook him by the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t so much as know your name,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ve opened my heart free to you, for
I&rsquo;m thankful to you; with good reason.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take your advice, and keep clear of this&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Justice,&rsquo; suggested Toby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the
name they give him.&nbsp; This Justice.&nbsp; And to-morrow will
try whether there&rsquo;s better fortun&rsquo; to be met with,
somewheres near London.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp; A Happy New
Year!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; cried Trotty, catching at his hand, as he
relaxed his grip.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay!&nbsp; The New Year never can
be happy to me, if we part like this.&nbsp; The New Year never
can be happy to me, if I see the child and you go wandering away,
you don&rsquo;t know where, without a shelter for your
heads.&nbsp; Come home with me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a poor man,
living in a poor place; but I can give you lodging for one night
and never miss it.&nbsp; Come home with me!&nbsp; Here!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take her!&rsquo; cried Trotty, lifting up the
child.&nbsp; &lsquo;A pretty one!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d carry twenty
times her weight, and never know I&rsquo;d got it.&nbsp; Tell me
if I go too quick for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very fast.&nbsp; I
always was!&rsquo;&nbsp; Trotty said this, taking about six of
his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion; and
with his thin legs quivering again, beneath the load he bore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s as light,&rsquo; said Trotty, trotting
in his speech as well as in his gait; for he couldn&rsquo;t bear
to be thanked, and dreaded a moment&rsquo;s pause; &lsquo;as
light as a feather.&nbsp; Lighter than a Peacock&rsquo;s
feather&mdash;a great deal lighter.&nbsp; Here we are and here we
go!&nbsp; Round this first turning to the right, Uncle Will, and
past the pump, and sharp off up the passage to the left, right
opposite the public-house.&nbsp; Here we are and here we
go!&nbsp; Cross over, Uncle Will, and mind the kidney pieman at
the corner!&nbsp; Here we are and here we go!&nbsp; Down the Mews
here, Uncle Will, and stop at the black door, with &ldquo;T.
Veck, Ticket Porter,&rdquo; wrote upon a board; and here we are
and here we go, and here we are indeed, my precious.&nbsp; Meg,
surprising you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With which words Trotty, in a breathless state, set the child
down before his daughter in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; The
little visitor looked once at Meg; and doubting nothing in that
face, but trusting everything she saw there; ran into her
arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here we are and here we go!&rsquo; cried Trotty,
running round the room, and choking audibly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,
Uncle Will, here&rsquo;s a fire you know!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t
you come to the fire?&nbsp; Oh here we are and here we go!&nbsp;
Meg, my precious darling, where&rsquo;s the kettle?&nbsp; Here it
is and here it goes, and it&rsquo;ll bile in no time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in
the course of his wild career and now put it on the fire: while
Meg, seating the child in a warm corner, knelt down on the ground
before her, and pulled off her shoes, and dried her wet feet on a
cloth.&nbsp; Ay, and she laughed at Trotty too&mdash;so
pleasantly, so cheerfully, that Trotty could have blessed her
where she kneeled; for he had seen that, when they entered, she
was sitting by the fire in tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father!&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
crazy to-night, I think.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what the Bells
would say to that.&nbsp; Poor little feet.&nbsp; How cold they
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re warmer now!&rsquo; exclaimed the
child.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re quite warm now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
haven&rsquo;t rubbed &rsquo;em half enough.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re so
busy.&nbsp; So busy!&nbsp; And when they&rsquo;re done,
we&rsquo;ll brush out the damp hair; and when that&rsquo;s done,
we&rsquo;ll bring some colour to the poor pale face with fresh
water; and when that&rsquo;s done, we&rsquo;ll be so gay, and
brisk, and happy&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child, in a burst of sobbing, clasped her round the neck;
caressed her fair cheek with its hand; and said, &lsquo;Oh Meg!
oh dear Meg!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Toby&rsquo;s blessing could have done no more.&nbsp; Who could
do more!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father!&rsquo; cried Meg, after a pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here I am and here I go, my dear!&rsquo; said
Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Gracious me!&rsquo; cried Meg.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s crazy!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s put the dear
child&rsquo;s bonnet on the kettle, and hung the lid behind the
door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t go for to do it, my love,&rsquo; said
Trotty, hastily repairing this mistake.&nbsp; &lsquo;Meg, my
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately
stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor, where
with many mysterious gestures he was holding up the sixpence he
had earned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see, my dear,&rsquo; said Trotty, &lsquo;as I was
coming in, half an ounce of tea lying somewhere on the stairs;
and I&rsquo;m pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too.&nbsp; As
I don&rsquo;t remember where it was exactly, I&rsquo;ll go myself
and try to find &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this inscrutable artifice, Toby withdrew to purchase the
viands he had spoken of, for ready money, at Mrs.
Chickenstalker&rsquo;s; and presently came back, pretending he
had not been able to find them, at first, in the dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But here they are at last,&rsquo; said Trotty, setting
out the tea-things, &lsquo;all correct!&nbsp; I was pretty sure
it was tea, and a rasher.&nbsp; So it is.&nbsp; Meg, my pet, if
you&rsquo;ll just make the tea, while your unworthy father toasts
the bacon, we shall be ready, immediate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
curious circumstance,&rsquo; said Trotty, proceeding in his
cookery, with the assistance of the toasting-fork,
&lsquo;curious, but well known to my friends, that I never care,
myself, for rashers, nor for tea.&nbsp; I like to see other
people enjoy &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said Trotty, speaking very loud,
to impress the fact upon his guest, &lsquo;but to me, as food,
they&rsquo;re disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet Trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing
bacon&mdash;ah!&mdash;as if he liked it; and when he poured the
boiling water in the tea-pot, looked lovingly down into the
depths of that snug cauldron, and suffered the fragrant steam to
curl about his nose, and wreathe his head and face in a thick
cloud.&nbsp; However, for all this, he neither ate nor drank,
except at the very beginning, a mere morsel for form&rsquo;s
sake, which he appeared to eat with infinite relish, but declared
was perfectly uninteresting to him.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Trotty&rsquo;s occupation was, to see Will Fern and
Lilian eat and drink; and so was Meg&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And never did
spectators at a city dinner or court banquet find such high
delight in seeing others feast: although it were a monarch or a
pope: as those two did, in looking on that night.&nbsp; Meg
smiled at Trotty, Trotty laughed at Meg.&nbsp; Meg shook her
head, and made belief to clap her hands, applauding Trotty;
Trotty conveyed, in dumb-show, unintelligible narratives of how
and when and where he had found their visitors, to Meg; and they
were happy.&nbsp; Very happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Although,&rsquo; thought Trotty, sorrowfully, as he
watched Meg&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;that match is broken off, I
see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; said Trotty after
tea.&nbsp; &lsquo;The little one, she sleeps with Meg, I
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With good Meg!&rsquo; cried the child, caressing
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;With Meg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she kiss Meg&rsquo;s
father, won&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> Meg&rsquo;s
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mightily delighted Trotty was, when the child went timidly
towards him, and having kissed him, fell back upon Meg again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s as sensible as Solomon,&rsquo; said
Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here we come and here we&mdash;no, we
don&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;I&mdash;what was
I saying, Meg, my precious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked towards their guest, who leaned upon her chair, and
with his face turned from her, fondled the child&rsquo;s head,
half hidden in her lap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said Toby.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be
sure!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m rambling on about,
to-night.&nbsp; My wits are wool-gathering, I think.&nbsp; Will
Fern, you come along with me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re tired to death,
and broken down for want of rest.&nbsp; You come along with
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man still played with the child&rsquo;s
curls, still leaned upon Meg&rsquo;s chair, still turned away his
face.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t speak, but in his rough coarse
fingers, clenching and expanding in the fair hair of the child,
there was an eloquence that said enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Trotty, answering unconsciously
what he saw expressed in his daughter&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take her with you, Meg.&nbsp; Get her to bed.&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; Now, Will, I&rsquo;ll show you where you lie.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not much of a place: only a loft; but, having a loft,
I always say, is one of the great conveniences of living in a
mews; and till this coach-house and stable gets a better let, we
live here cheap.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s plenty of sweet hay up
there, belonging to a neighbour; and it&rsquo;s as clean as
hands, and Meg, can make it.&nbsp; Cheer up!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
give way.&nbsp; A new heart for a New Year, always!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hand released from the child&rsquo;s hair, had fallen,
trembling, into Trotty&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; So Trotty, talking
without intermission, led him out as tenderly and easily as if he
had been a child himself.&nbsp; Returning before Meg, he listened
for an instant at the door of her little chamber; an adjoining
room.&nbsp; The child was murmuring a simple Prayer before lying
down to sleep; and when she had remembered Meg&rsquo;s name,
&lsquo;Dearly, Dearly&rsquo;&mdash;so her words ran&mdash;Trotty
heard her stop and ask for his.</p>
<p>It was some short time before the foolish little old fellow
could compose himself to mend the fire, and draw his chair to the
warm hearth.&nbsp; But, when he had done so, and had trimmed the
light, he took his newspaper from his pocket, and began to
read.&nbsp; Carelessly at first, and skimming up and down the
columns; but with an earnest and a sad attention, very soon.</p>
<p>For this same dreaded paper re-directed Trotty&rsquo;s
thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day, and which
the day&rsquo;s events had so marked out and shaped.&nbsp; His
interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of
thinking, and a happier one, for the time; but being alone again,
and reading of the crimes and violences of the people, he
relapsed into his former train.</p>
<p>In this mood, he came to an account (and it was not the first
he had ever read) of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not
only on her own life but on that of her young child.&nbsp; A
crime so terrible, and so revolting to his soul, dilated with the
love of Meg, that he let the journal drop, and fell back in his
chair, appalled!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unnatural and cruel!&rsquo; Toby cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Unnatural and cruel!&nbsp; None but people who were bad at
heart, born bad, who had no business on the earth, could do such
deeds.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too true, all I&rsquo;ve heard to-day;
too just, too full of proof.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re Bad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Chimes took up the words so suddenly&mdash;burst out so
loud, and clear, and sonorous&mdash;that the Bells seemed to
strike him in his chair.</p>
<p>And what was that, they said?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Toby Veck, Toby Veck, waiting for you Toby!&nbsp; Toby
Veck, Toby Veck, waiting for you Toby!&nbsp; Come and see us,
come and see us, Drag him to us, drag him to us, Haunt and hunt
him, haunt and hunt him, Break his slumbers, break his
slumbers!&nbsp; Toby Veck Toby Veck, door open wide Toby, Toby
Veck Toby Veck, door open wide Toby&mdash;&rsquo; then fiercely
back to their impetuous strain again, and ringing in the very
bricks and plaster on the walls.</p>
<p>Toby listened.&nbsp; Fancy, fancy!&nbsp; His remorse for
having run away from them that afternoon!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp;
Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Again, again, and yet a dozen times
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Haunt and hunt him, haunt and hunt him, Drag
him to us, drag him to us!&rsquo;&nbsp; Deafening the whole
town!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meg,&rsquo; said Trotty softly: tapping at her
door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you hear anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear the Bells, father.&nbsp; Surely they&rsquo;re
very loud to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she asleep?&rsquo; said Toby, making an excuse for
peeping in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So peacefully and happily!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t leave
her yet though, father.&nbsp; Look how she holds my
hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meg,&rsquo; whispered Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Listen to
the Bells!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She listened, with her face towards him all the time.&nbsp;
But it underwent no change.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t understand
them.</p>
<p>Trotty withdrew, resumed his seat by the fire, and once more
listened by himself.&nbsp; He remained here a little time.</p>
<p>It was impossible to bear it; their energy was dreadful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the tower-door is really open,&rsquo; said Toby,
hastily laying aside his apron, but never thinking of his hat,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s to hinder me from going up into the steeple
and satisfying myself?&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s shut, I don&rsquo;t
want any other satisfaction.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the
street that he should find it shut and locked, for he knew the
door well, and had so rarely seen it open, that he couldn&rsquo;t
reckon above three times in all.&nbsp; It was a low arched
portal, outside the church, in a dark nook behind a column; and
had such great iron hinges, and such a monstrous lock, that there
was more hinge and lock than door.</p>
<p>But what was his astonishment when, coming bare-headed to the
church; and putting his hand into this dark nook, with a certain
misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized, and a shivering
propensity to draw it back again; he found that the door, which
opened outwards, actually stood ajar!</p>
<p>He thought, on the first surprise, of going back; or of
getting a light, or a companion, but his courage aided him
immediately, and he determined to ascend alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I to fear?&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a church!&nbsp; Besides, the ringers may be
there, and have forgotten to shut the door.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he
went in, feeling his way as he went, like a blind man; for it was
very dark.&nbsp; And very quiet, for the Chimes were silent.</p>
<p>The dust from the street had blown into the recess; and lying
there, heaped up, made it so soft and velvet-like to the foot,
that there was something startling, even in that.&nbsp; The
narrow stair was so close to the door, too, that he stumbled at
the very first; and shutting the door upon himself, by striking
it with his foot, and causing it to rebound back heavily, he
couldn&rsquo;t open it again.</p>
<p>This was another reason, however, for going on.&nbsp; Trotty
groped his way, and went on.&nbsp; Up, up, up, and round, and
round; and up, up, up; higher, higher, higher up!</p>
<p>It was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work; so low
and narrow, that his groping hand was always touching something;
and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up
erect and making room for him to pass without discovery, that he
would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face, and
downward searching for its feet, while a chill tingling crept all
over him.&nbsp; Twice or thrice, a door or niche broke the
monotonous surface; and then it seemed a gap as wide as the whole
church; and he felt on the brink of an abyss, and going to tumble
headlong down, until he found the wall again.</p>
<p>Still up, up, up; and round and round; and up, up, up; higher,
higher, higher up!</p>
<p>At length, the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen:
presently to feel quite windy: presently it blew so strong, that
he could hardly keep his legs.&nbsp; But, he got to an arched
window in the tower, breast high, and holding tight, looked down
upon the house-tops, on the smoking chimneys, on the blur and
blotch of lights (towards the place where Meg was wondering where
he was and calling to him perhaps), all kneaded up together in a
leaven of mist and darkness.</p>
<p>This was the belfry, where the ringers came.&nbsp; He had
caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through
apertures in the oaken roof.&nbsp; At first he started, thinking
it was hair; then trembled at the very thought of waking the deep
Bell.&nbsp; The Bells themselves were higher.&nbsp; Higher,
Trotty, in his fascination, or in working out the spell upon him,
groped his way.&nbsp; By ladders now, and toilsomely, for it was
steep, and not too certain holding for the feet.</p>
<p>Up, up, up; and climb and clamber; up, up, up; higher, higher,
higher up!</p>
<p>Until, ascending through the floor, and pausing with his head
just raised above its beams, he came among the Bells.&nbsp; It
was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom;
but there they were.&nbsp; Shadowy, and dark, and dumb.</p>
<p>A heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him,
as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal.&nbsp; His
head went round and round.&nbsp; He listened, and then raised a
wild &lsquo;Holloa!&rsquo;&nbsp; Holloa! was mournfully
protracted by the echoes.</p>
<p>Giddy, confused, and out of breath, and frightened, Toby
looked about him vacantly, and sunk down in a swoon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;Third Quarter.</h2>
<p>Black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters,
when the Sea of Thought, first heaving from a calm, gives up its
Dead.&nbsp; Monsters uncouth and wild, arise in premature,
imperfect resurrection; the several parts and shapes of different
things are joined and mixed by chance; and when, and how, and by
what wonderful degrees, each separates from each, and every sense
and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives again, no
man&mdash;though every man is every day the casket of this type
of the Great Mystery&mdash;can tell.</p>
<p>So, when and how the darkness of the night-black steeple
changed to shining light; when and how the solitary tower was
peopled with a myriad figures; when and how the whispered
&lsquo;Haunt and hunt him,&rsquo; breathing monotonously through
his sleep or swoon, became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears
of Trotty, &lsquo;Break his slumbers;&rsquo; when and how he
ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things
were, companioning a host of others that were not; there are no
dates or means to tell.&nbsp; But, awake and standing on his feet
upon the boards where he had lately lain, he saw this Goblin
Sight.</p>
<p>He saw the tower, whither his charmed footsteps had brought
him, swarming with dwarf phantoms, spirits, elfin creatures of
the Bells.&nbsp; He saw them leaping, flying, dropping, pouring
from the Bells without a pause.&nbsp; He saw them, round him on
the ground; above him, in the air; clambering from him, by the
ropes below; looking down upon him, from the massive iron-girded
beams; peeping in upon him, through the chinks and loopholes in
the walls; spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles,
as the water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes
plashing in among them.&nbsp; He saw them, of all aspects and all
shapes.&nbsp; He saw them ugly, handsome, crippled, exquisitely
formed.&nbsp; He saw them young, he saw them old, he saw them
kind, he saw them cruel, he saw them merry, he saw them grim; he
saw them dance, and heard them sing; he saw them tear their hair,
and heard them howl.&nbsp; He saw the air thick with them.&nbsp;
He saw them come and go, incessantly.&nbsp; He saw them riding
downward, soaring upward, sailing off afar, perching near at
hand, all restless and all violently active.&nbsp; Stone, and
brick, and slate, and tile, became transparent to him as to
them.&nbsp; He saw them <i>in</i> the houses, busy at the
sleepers&rsquo; beds.&nbsp; He saw them soothing people in their
dreams; he saw them beating them with knotted whips; he saw them
yelling in their ears; he saw them playing softest music on their
pillows; he saw them cheering some with the songs of birds and
the perfume of flowers; he saw them flashing awful faces on the
troubled rest of others, from enchanted mirrors which they
carried in their hands.</p>
<p>He saw these creatures, not only among sleeping men but waking
also, active in pursuits irreconcilable with one another, and
possessing or assuming natures the most opposite.&nbsp; He saw
one buckling on innumerable wings to increase his speed; another
loading himself with chains and weights, to retard his.&nbsp; He
saw some putting the hands of clocks forward, some putting the
hands of clocks backward, some endeavouring to stop the clock
entirely.&nbsp; He saw them representing, here a marriage
ceremony, there a funeral; in this chamber an election, in that a
ball he saw, everywhere, restless and untiring motion.</p>
<p>Bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures,
as well as by the uproar of the Bells, which all this while were
ringing, Trotty clung to a wooden pillar for support, and turned
his white face here and there, in mute and stunned
astonishment.</p>
<p>As he gazed, the Chimes stopped.&nbsp; Instantaneous
change!&nbsp; The whole swarm fainted! their forms collapsed,
their speed deserted them; they sought to fly, but in the act of
falling died and melted into air.&nbsp; No fresh supply succeeded
them.&nbsp; One straggler leaped down pretty briskly from the
surface of the Great Bell, and alighted on his feet, but he was
dead and gone before he could turn round.&nbsp; Some few of the
late company who had gambolled in the tower, remained there,
spinning over and over a little longer; but these became at every
turn more faint, and few, and feeble, and soon went the way of
the rest.&nbsp; The last of all was one small hunchback, who had
got into an echoing corner, where he twirled and twirled, and
floated by himself a long time; showing such perseverance, that
at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a foot, before he
finally retired; but he vanished in the end, and then the tower
was silent.</p>
<p>Then and not before, did Trotty see in every Bell a bearded
figure of the bulk and stature of the
Bell&mdash;incomprehensibly, a figure and the Bell itself.&nbsp;
Gigantic, grave, and darkly watchful of him, as he stood rooted
to the ground.</p>
<p>Mysterious and awful figures!&nbsp; Resting on nothing; poised
in the night air of the tower, with their draped and hooded heads
merged in the dim roof; motionless and shadowy.&nbsp; Shadowy and
dark, although he saw them by some light belonging to
themselves&mdash;none else was there&mdash;each with its muffled
hand upon its goblin mouth.</p>
<p>He could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the
floor; for all power of motion had deserted him.&nbsp; Otherwise
he would have done so&mdash;aye, would have thrown himself,
headforemost, from the steeple-top, rather than have seen them
watching him with eyes that would have waked and watched although
the pupils had been taken out.</p>
<p>Again, again, the dread and terror of the lonely place, and of
the wild and fearful night that reigned there, touched him like a
spectral hand.&nbsp; His distance from all help; the long, dark,
winding, ghost-beleaguered way that lay between him and the earth
on which men lived; his being high, high, high, up there, where
it had made him dizzy to see the birds fly in the day; cut off
from all good people, who at such an hour were safe at home and
sleeping in their beds; all this struck coldly through him, not
as a reflection but a bodily sensation.&nbsp; Meantime his eyes
and thoughts and fears, were fixed upon the watchful figures;
which, rendered unlike any figures of this world by the deep
gloom and shade enwrapping and enfolding them, as well as by
their looks and forms and supernatural hovering above the floor,
were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were the stalwart
oaken frames, cross-pieces, bars and beams, set up there to
support the Bells.&nbsp; These hemmed them, in a very forest of
hewn timber; from the entanglements, intricacies, and depths of
which, as from among the boughs of a dead wood blighted for their
phantom use, they kept their darksome and unwinking watch.</p>
<p>A blast of air&mdash;how cold and shrill!&mdash;came moaning
through the tower.&nbsp; As it died away, the Great Bell, or the
Goblin of the Great Bell, spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What visitor is this!&rsquo; it said.&nbsp; The voice
was low and deep, and Trotty fancied that it sounded in the other
figures as well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought my name was called by the Chimes!&rsquo; said
Trotty, raising his hands in an attitude of supplication.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hardly know why I am here, or how I came.&nbsp; I have
listened to the Chimes these many years.&nbsp; They have cheered
me often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have thanked them?&rsquo; said the Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A thousand times!&rsquo; cried Trotty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a poor man,&rsquo; faltered Trotty, &lsquo;and
could only thank them in words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And always so?&rsquo; inquired the Goblin of the
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you never done us wrong in
words?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Trotty eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never done us foul, and false, and wicked wrong, in
words?&rsquo; pursued the Goblin of the Bell.</p>
<p>Trotty was about to answer, &lsquo;Never!&rsquo;&nbsp; But he
stopped, and was confused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The voice of Time,&rsquo; said the Phantom,
&lsquo;cries to man, Advance!&nbsp; Time is for his advancement
and improvement; for his greater worth, his greater happiness,
his better life; his progress onward to that goal within its
knowledge and its view, and set there, in the period when Time
and He began.&nbsp; Ages of darkness, wickedness, and violence,
have come and gone&mdash;millions uncountable, have suffered,
lived, and died&mdash;to point the way before him.&nbsp; Who
seeks to turn him back, or stay him on his course, arrests a
mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead; and be the
fiercer and the wilder, ever, for its momentary check!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never did so to my knowledge, sir,&rsquo; said
Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was quite by accident if I did.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t go to do it, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who puts into the mouth of Time, or of its
servants,&rsquo; said the Goblin of the Bell, &lsquo;a cry of
lamentation for days which have had their trial and their
failure, and have left deep traces of it which the blind may
see&mdash;a cry that only serves the present time, by showing men
how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets
for such a past&mdash;who does this, does a wrong.&nbsp; And you
have done that wrong, to us, the Chimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty&rsquo;s first excess of fear was gone.&nbsp; But he had
felt tenderly and gratefully towards the Bells, as you have seen;
and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them
so weightily, his heart was touched with penitence and grief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you knew,&rsquo; said Trotty, clasping his hands
earnestly&mdash;&lsquo;or perhaps you do know&mdash;if you know
how often you have kept me company; how often you have cheered me
up when I&rsquo;ve been low; how you were quite the plaything of
my little daughter Meg (almost the only one she ever had) when
first her mother died, and she and me were left alone; you
won&rsquo;t bear malice for a hasty word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking
disregard, or stern regard, of any hope, or joy, or pain, or
sorrow, of the many-sorrowed throng; who hears us make response
to any creed that gauges human passions and affections, as it
gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine
and wither; does us wrong.&nbsp; That wrong you have done
us!&rsquo; said the Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have!&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh forgive
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth: the
Putters Down of crushed and broken natures, formed to be raised
up higher than such maggots of the time can crawl or can
conceive,&rsquo; pursued the Goblin of the Bell; &lsquo;who does
so, does us wrong.&nbsp; And you have done us wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not meaning it,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;In my
ignorance.&nbsp; Not meaning it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lastly, and most of all,&rsquo; pursued the Bell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his
kind; abandons them as vile; and does not trace and track with
pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from
good&mdash;grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that
lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in
the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to
eternity.&nbsp; And you have done that wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spare me!&rsquo; cried Trotty, falling on his knees;
&lsquo;for Mercy&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said the Shadow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; cried the other Shadows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said a clear and childlike voice, which
Trotty thought he recognised as having heard before.</p>
<p>The organ sounded faintly in the church below.&nbsp; Swelling
by degrees, the melody ascended to the roof, and filled the choir
and nave.&nbsp; Expanding more and more, it rose up, up; up, up;
higher, higher, higher up; awakening agitated hearts within the
burly piles of oak: the hollow bells, the iron-bound doors, the
stairs of solid stone; until the tower walls were insufficient to
contain it, and it soared into the sky.</p>
<p>No wonder that an old man&rsquo;s breast could not contain a
sound so vast and mighty.&nbsp; It broke from that weak prison in
a rush of tears; and Trotty put his hands before his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said the Shadow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said the other Shadows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said the child&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>A solemn strain of blended voices, rose into the tower.</p>
<p>It was a very low and mournful strain&mdash;a Dirge&mdash;and
as he listened, Trotty heard his child among the singers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is dead!&rsquo; exclaimed the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Meg is dead!&nbsp; Her Spirit calls to me.&nbsp; I hear
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Spirit of your child bewails the dead, and mingles
with the dead&mdash;dead hopes, dead fancies, dead imaginings of
youth,&rsquo; returned the Bell, &lsquo;but she is living.&nbsp;
Learn from her life, a living truth.&nbsp; Learn from the
creature dearest to your heart, how bad the bad are born.&nbsp;
See every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest
stem, and know how bare and wretched it may be.&nbsp; Follow
her!&nbsp; To desperation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth, and
pointed downward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Spirit of the Chimes is your companion,&rsquo; said
the figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go!&nbsp; It stands behind you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty turned, and saw&mdash;the child!&nbsp; The child Will
Fern had carried in the street; the child whom Meg had watched,
but now, asleep!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I carried her myself, to-night,&rsquo; said
Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;In these arms!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Show him what he calls himself,&rsquo; said the dark
figures, one and all.</p>
<p>The tower opened at his feet.&nbsp; He looked down, and beheld
his own form, lying at the bottom, on the outside: crushed and
motionless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more a living man!&rsquo; cried Trotty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; said the figures all together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gracious Heaven!&nbsp; And the New
Year&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Past,&rsquo; said the figures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; he cried, shuddering.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
missed my way, and coming on the outside of this tower in the
dark, fell down&mdash;a year ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nine years ago!&rsquo; replied the figures.</p>
<p>As they gave the answer, they recalled their outstretched
hands; and where their figures had been, there the Bells
were.</p>
<p>And they rung; their time being come again.&nbsp; And once
again, vast multitudes of phantoms sprung into existence; once
again, were incoherently engaged, as they had been before; once
again, faded on the stopping of the Chimes; and dwindled into
nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are these?&rsquo; he asked his guide.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I am not mad, what are these?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spirits of the Bells.&nbsp; Their sound upon the
air,&rsquo; returned the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;They take such
shapes and occupations as the hopes and thoughts of mortals, and
the recollections they have stored up, give them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you,&rsquo; said Trotty wildly.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; returned the child.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a poor, mean room; working at the same kind of embroidery
which he had often, often seen before her; Meg, his own dear
daughter, was presented to his view.&nbsp; He made no effort to
imprint his kisses on her face; he did not strive to clasp her to
his loving heart; he knew that such endearments were, for him, no
more.&nbsp; But, he held his trembling breath, and brushed away
the blinding tears, that he might look upon her; that he might
only see her.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; Changed.&nbsp; Changed.&nbsp; The light of the clear
eye, how dimmed.&nbsp; The bloom, how faded from the cheek.&nbsp;
Beautiful she was, as she had ever been, but Hope, Hope, Hope, oh
where was the fresh Hope that had spoken to him like a voice!</p>
<p>She looked up from her work, at a companion.&nbsp; Following
her eyes, the old man started back.</p>
<p>In the woman grown, he recognised her at a glance.&nbsp; In
the long silken hair, he saw the self-same curls; around the
lips, the child&rsquo;s expression lingering still.&nbsp;
See!&nbsp; In the eyes, now turned inquiringly on Meg, there
shone the very look that scanned those features when he brought
her home!</p>
<p>Then what was this, beside him!</p>
<p>Looking with awe into its face, he saw a something reigning
there: a lofty something, undefined and indistinct, which made it
hardly more than a remembrance of that child&mdash;as yonder
figure might be&mdash;yet it was the same: the same: and wore the
dress.</p>
<p>Hark.&nbsp; They were speaking!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meg,&rsquo; said Lilian, hesitating.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
often you raise your head from your work to look at
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are my looks so altered, that they frighten you?&rsquo;
asked Meg.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, dear!&nbsp; But you smile at that, yourself!&nbsp;
Why not smile, when you look at me, Meg?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do so.&nbsp; Do I not?&rsquo; she answered: smiling
on her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you do,&rsquo; said Lilian, &lsquo;but not
usually.&nbsp; When you think I&rsquo;m busy, and don&rsquo;t see
you, you look so anxious and so doubtful, that I hardly like to
raise my eyes.&nbsp; There is little cause for smiling in this
hard and toilsome life, but you were once so cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I not now!&rsquo; cried Meg, speaking in a tone of
strange alarm, and rising to embrace her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do I make
our weary life more weary to you, Lilian!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been the only thing that made it life,&rsquo;
said Lilian, fervently kissing her; &lsquo;sometimes the only
thing that made me care to live so, Meg.&nbsp; Such work, such
work!&nbsp; So many hours, so many days, so many long, long
nights of hopeless, cheerless, never-ending work&mdash;not to
heap up riches, not to live grandly or gaily, not to live upon
enough, however coarse; but to earn bare bread; to scrape
together just enough to toil upon, and want upon, and keep alive
in us the consciousness of our hard fate!&nbsp; Oh Meg,
Meg!&rsquo; she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as
she spoke, like one in pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can the cruel world
go round, and bear to look upon such lives!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lilly!&rsquo; said Meg, soothing her, and putting back
her hair from her wet face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Lilly!&nbsp;
You!&nbsp; So pretty and so young!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Meg!&rsquo; she interrupted, holding her at
arm&rsquo;s-length, and looking in her face imploringly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The worst of all, the worst of all!&nbsp; Strike me old,
Meg!&nbsp; Wither me, and shrivel me, and free me from the
dreadful thoughts that tempt me in my youth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty turned to look upon his guide.&nbsp; But the Spirit of
the child had taken flight.&nbsp; Was gone.</p>
<p>Neither did he himself remain in the same place; for, Sir
Joseph Bowley, Friend and Father of the Poor, held a great
festivity at Bowley Hall, in honour of the natal day of Lady
Bowley.&nbsp; And as Lady Bowley had been born on New
Year&rsquo;s Day (which the local newspapers considered an
especial pointing of the finger of Providence to number One, as
Lady Bowley&rsquo;s destined figure in Creation), it was on a New
Year&rsquo;s Day that this festivity took place.</p>
<p>Bowley Hall was full of visitors.&nbsp; The red-faced
gentleman was there, Mr. Filer was there, the great Alderman Cute
was there&mdash;Alderman Cute had a sympathetic feeling with
great people, and had considerably improved his acquaintance with
Sir Joseph Bowley on the strength of his attentive letter: indeed
had become quite a friend of the family since then&mdash;and many
guests were there.&nbsp; Trotty&rsquo;s ghost was there,
wandering about, poor phantom, drearily; and looking for its
guide.</p>
<p>There was to be a great dinner in the Great Hall.&nbsp; At
which Sir Joseph Bowley, in his celebrated character of Friend
and Father of the Poor, was to make his great speech.&nbsp;
Certain plum-puddings were to be eaten by his Friends and
Children in another Hall first; and, at a given signal, Friends
and Children flocking in among their Friends and Fathers, were to
form a family assemblage, with not one manly eye therein
unmoistened by emotion.</p>
<p>But, there was more than this to happen.&nbsp; Even more than
this.&nbsp; Sir Joseph Bowley, Baronet and Member of Parliament,
was to play a match at skittles&mdash;real skittles&mdash;with
his tenants!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which quite reminds me,&rsquo; said Alderman Cute,
&lsquo;of the days of old King Hal, stout King Hal, bluff King
Hal.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Fine character!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said Mr. Filer, dryly.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
marrying women and murdering &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Considerably more
than the average number of wives by the bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll marry the beautiful ladies, and not murder
&rsquo;em, eh?&rsquo; said Alderman Cute to the heir of Bowley,
aged twelve.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sweet boy!&nbsp; We shall have this
little gentleman in Parliament now,&rsquo; said the Alderman,
holding him by the shoulders, and looking as reflective as he
could, &lsquo;before we know where we are.&nbsp; We shall hear of
his successes at the poll; his speeches in the House; his
overtures from Governments; his brilliant achievements of all
kinds; ah! we shall make our little orations about him in the
Common Council, I&rsquo;ll be bound; before we have time to look
about us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the difference of shoes and stockings!&rsquo;
Trotty thought.&nbsp; But his heart yearned towards the child,
for the love of those same shoeless and stockingless boys,
predestined (by the Alderman) to turn out bad, who might have
been the children of poor Meg.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard,&rsquo; moaned Trotty, roaming among the
company, to and fro; &lsquo;where is he?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find
Richard!&nbsp; Where is Richard?&rsquo;&nbsp; Not likely to be
there, if still alive!&nbsp; But Trotty&rsquo;s grief and
solitude confused him; and he still went wandering among the
gallant company, looking for his guide, and saying, &lsquo;Where
is Richard?&nbsp; Show me Richard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was wandering thus, when he encountered Mr. Fish, the
confidential Secretary: in great agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my heart and soul!&rsquo; cried Mr. Fish.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Alderman Cute?&nbsp; Has anybody seen the
Alderman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seen the Alderman?&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; Who could ever help
seeing the Alderman?&nbsp; He was so considerate, so affable, he
bore so much in mind the natural desires of folks to see him,
that if he had a fault, it was the being constantly On
View.&nbsp; And wherever the great people were, there, to be
sure, attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls, was
Cute.</p>
<p>Several voices cried that he was in the circle round Sir
Joseph.&nbsp; Mr. Fish made way there; found him; and took him
secretly into a window near at hand.&nbsp; Trotty joined
them.&nbsp; Not of his own accord.&nbsp; He felt that his steps
were led in that direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Alderman Cute,&rsquo; said Mr. Fish.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A little more this way.&nbsp; The most dreadful
circumstance has occurred.&nbsp; I have this moment received the
intelligence.&nbsp; I think it will be best not to acquaint Sir
Joseph with it till the day is over.&nbsp; You understand Sir
Joseph, and will give me your opinion.&nbsp; The most frightful
and deplorable event!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fish!&rsquo; returned the Alderman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fish!&nbsp; My good fellow, what is the matter?&nbsp;
Nothing revolutionary, I hope!&nbsp; No&mdash;no attempted
interference with the magistrates?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Deedles, the banker,&rsquo; gasped the Secretary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Deedles Brothers&mdash;who was to have been here
to-day&mdash;high in office in the Goldsmiths&rsquo;
Company&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not stopped!&rsquo; exclaimed the Alderman, &lsquo;It
can&rsquo;t be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shot himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put a double-barrelled pistol to his mouth, in his own
counting house,&rsquo; said Mr. Fish, &lsquo;and blew his brains
out.&nbsp; No motive.&nbsp; Princely circumstances!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Circumstances!&rsquo; exclaimed the Alderman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A man of noble fortune.&nbsp; One of the most respectable
of men.&nbsp; Suicide, Mr. Fish!&nbsp; By his own
hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This very morning,&rsquo; returned Mr. Fish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh the brain, the brain!&rsquo; exclaimed the pious
Alderman, lifting up his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh the nerves, the
nerves; the mysteries of this machine called Man!&nbsp; Oh the
little that unhinges it: poor creatures that we are!&nbsp;
Perhaps a dinner, Mr. Fish.&nbsp; Perhaps the conduct of his son,
who, I have heard, ran very wild, and was in the habit of drawing
bills upon him without the least authority!&nbsp; A most
respectable man.&nbsp; One of the most respectable men I ever
knew!&nbsp; A lamentable instance, Mr. Fish.&nbsp; A public
calamity!&nbsp; I shall make a point of wearing the deepest
mourning.&nbsp; A most respectable man!&nbsp; But there is One
above.&nbsp; We must submit, Mr. Fish.&nbsp; We must
submit!&rsquo;</p>
<p>What, Alderman!&nbsp; No word of Putting Down?&nbsp; Remember,
Justice, your high moral boast and pride.&nbsp; Come,
Alderman!&nbsp; Balance those scales.&nbsp; Throw me into this,
the empty one, no dinner, and Nature&rsquo;s founts in some poor
woman, dried by starving misery and rendered obdurate to claims
for which her offspring <i>has</i> authority in holy mother
Eve.&nbsp; Weigh me the two, you Daniel, going to judgment, when
your day shall come!&nbsp; Weigh them, in the eyes of suffering
thousands, audience (not unmindful) of the grim farce you
play.&nbsp; Or supposing that you strayed from your five
wits&mdash;it&rsquo;s not so far to go, but that it might
be&mdash;and laid hands upon that throat of yours, warning your
fellows (if you have a fellow) how they croak their comfortable
wickedness to raving heads and stricken hearts.&nbsp; What
then?</p>
<p>The words rose up in Trotty&rsquo;s breast, as if they had
been spoken by some other voice within him.&nbsp; Alderman Cute
pledged himself to Mr. Fish that he would assist him in breaking
the melancholy catastrophe to Sir Joseph when the day was
over.&nbsp; Then, before they parted, wringing Mr. Fish&rsquo;s
hand in bitterness of soul, he said, &lsquo;The most respectable
of men!&rsquo;&nbsp; And added that he hardly knew (not even he),
why such afflictions were allowed on earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s almost enough to make one think, if one
didn&rsquo;t know better,&rsquo; said Alderman Cute, &lsquo;that
at times some motion of a capsizing nature was going on in
things, which affected the general economy of the social
fabric.&nbsp; Deedles Brothers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The skittle-playing came off with immense success.&nbsp; Sir
Joseph knocked the pins about quite skilfully; Master Bowley took
an innings at a shorter distance also; and everybody said that
now, when a Baronet and the Son of a Baronet played at skittles,
the country was coming round again, as fast as it could come.</p>
<p>At its proper time, the Banquet was served up.&nbsp; Trotty
involuntarily repaired to the Hall with the rest, for he felt
himself conducted thither by some stronger impulse than his own
free will.&nbsp; The sight was gay in the extreme; the ladies
were very handsome; the visitors delighted, cheerful, and
good-tempered.&nbsp; When the lower doors were opened, and the
people flocked in, in their rustic dresses, the beauty of the
spectacle was at its height; but Trotty only murmured more and
more, &lsquo;Where is Richard!&nbsp; He should help and comfort
her!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t see Richard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There had been some speeches made; and Lady Bowley&rsquo;s
health had been proposed; and Sir Joseph Bowley had returned
thanks, and had made his great speech, showing by various pieces
of evidence that he was the born Friend and Father, and so forth;
and had given as a Toast, his Friends and Children, and the
Dignity of Labour; when a slight disturbance at the bottom of the
Hall attracted Toby&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; After some confusion,
noise, and opposition, one man broke through the rest, and stood
forward by himself.</p>
<p>Not Richard.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But one whom he had thought of,
and had looked for, many times.&nbsp; In a scantier supply of
light, he might have doubted the identity of that worn man, so
old, and grey, and bent; but with a blaze of lamps upon his
gnarled and knotted head, he knew Will Fern as soon as he stepped
forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Joseph,
rising.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who gave this man admittance?&nbsp; This is
a criminal from prison!&nbsp; Mr. Fish, sir, <i>will</i> you have
the goodness&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A minute!&rsquo; said Will Fern.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
minute!&nbsp; My Lady, you was born on this day along with a New
Year.&nbsp; Get me a minute&rsquo;s leave to speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made some intercession for him.&nbsp; Sir Joseph took his
seat again, with native dignity.</p>
<p>The ragged visitor&mdash;for he was miserably
dressed&mdash;looked round upon the company, and made his homage
to them with a humble bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlefolks!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
drunk the Labourer.&nbsp; Look at me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just come from jail,&rsquo; said Mr. Fish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just come from jail,&rsquo; said Will.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
neither for the first time, nor the second, nor the third, nor
yet the fourth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Filer was heard to remark testily, that four times was
over the average; and he ought to be ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlefolks!&rsquo; repeated Will Fern.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look at me!&nbsp; You see I&rsquo;m at the worst.&nbsp;
Beyond all hurt or harm; beyond your help; for the time when your
kind words or kind actions could have done me
good,&rsquo;&mdash;he struck his hand upon his breast, and shook
his head, &lsquo;is gone, with the scent of last year&rsquo;s
beans or clover on the air.&nbsp; Let me say a word for
these,&rsquo; pointing to the labouring people in the Hall;
&lsquo;and when you&rsquo;re met together, hear the real Truth
spoke out for once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a man here,&rsquo; said the host,
&lsquo;who would have him for a spokesman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like enough, Sir Joseph.&nbsp; I believe it.&nbsp; Not
the less true, perhaps, is what I say.&nbsp; Perhaps that&rsquo;s
a proof on it.&nbsp; Gentlefolks, I&rsquo;ve lived many a year in
this place.&nbsp; You may see the cottage from the sunk fence
over yonder.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen the ladies draw it in their
books, a hundred times.&nbsp; It looks well in a picter,
I&rsquo;ve heerd say; but there an&rsquo;t weather in picters,
and maybe &rsquo;tis fitter for that, than for a place to live
in.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I lived there.&nbsp; How hard&mdash;how
bitter hard, I lived there, I won&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; Any day in
the year, and every day, you can judge for your own
selves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke as he had spoken on the night when Trotty found him
in the street.&nbsp; His voice was deeper and more husky, and had
a trembling in it now and then; but he never raised it
passionately, and seldom lifted it above the firm stern level of
the homely facts he stated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis harder than you think for, gentlefolks, to
grow up decent, commonly decent, in such a place.&nbsp; That I
growed up a man and not a brute, says something for me&mdash;as I
was then.&nbsp; As I am now, there&rsquo;s nothing can be said
for me or done for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m past it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad this man has entered,&rsquo; observed Sir
Joseph, looking round serenely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb
him.&nbsp; It appears to be Ordained.&nbsp; He is an example: a
living example.&nbsp; I hope and trust, and confidently expect,
that it will not be lost upon my Friends here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dragged on,&rsquo; said Fern, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence, &lsquo;somehow.&nbsp; Neither me nor any other man knows
how; but so heavy, that I couldn&rsquo;t put a cheerful face upon
it, or make believe that I was anything but what I was.&nbsp;
Now, gentlemen&mdash;you gentlemen that sits at
Sessions&mdash;when you see a man with discontent writ on his
face, you says to one another, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
suspicious.&nbsp; I has my doubts,&rdquo; says you, &ldquo;about
Will Fern.&nbsp; Watch that fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
say, gentlemen, it ain&rsquo;t quite nat&rsquo;ral, but I say
&rsquo;tis so; and from that hour, whatever Will Fern does, or
lets alone&mdash;all one&mdash;it goes against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alderman Cute stuck his thumbs in his waistcoat-pockets, and
leaning back in his chair, and smiling, winked at a neighbouring
chandelier.&nbsp; As much as to say, &lsquo;Of course!&nbsp; I
told you so.&nbsp; The common cry!&nbsp; Lord bless you, we are
up to all this sort of thing&mdash;myself and human
nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Will Fern, holding out his
hands, and flushing for an instant in his haggard face,
&lsquo;see how your laws are made to trap and hunt us when
we&rsquo;re brought to this.&nbsp; I tries to live
elsewhere.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m a vagabond.&nbsp; To jail with
him!&nbsp; I comes back here.&nbsp; I goes a-nutting in your
woods, and breaks&mdash;who don&rsquo;t?&mdash;a limber branch or
two.&nbsp; To jail with him!&nbsp; One of your keepers sees me in
the broad day, near my own patch of garden, with a gun.&nbsp; To
jail with him!&nbsp; I has a nat&rsquo;ral angry word with that
man, when I&rsquo;m free again.&nbsp; To jail with him!&nbsp; I
cuts a stick.&nbsp; To jail with him!&nbsp; I eats a rotten apple
or a turnip.&nbsp; To jail with him!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s twenty mile
away; and coming back I begs a trifle on the road.&nbsp; To jail
with him!&nbsp; At last, the constable, the
keeper&mdash;anybody&mdash;finds me anywhere, a-doing
anything.&nbsp; To jail with him, for he&rsquo;s a vagrant, and a
jail-bird known; and jail&rsquo;s the only home he&rsquo;s
got.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Alderman nodded sagaciously, as who should say, &lsquo;A
very good home too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I say this to serve <span class="smcap">my</span>
cause!&rsquo; cried Fern.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who can give me back my
liberty, who can give me back my good name, who can give me back
my innocent niece?&nbsp; Not all the Lords and Ladies in wide
England.&nbsp; But, gentlemen, gentlemen, dealing with other men
like me, begin at the right end.&nbsp; Give us, in mercy, better
homes when we&rsquo;re a-lying in our cradles; give us better
food when we&rsquo;re a-working for our lives; give us kinder
laws to bring us back when we're a-going wrong; and don&rsquo;t
set jail, jail, jail, afore us, everywhere we turn.&nbsp; There
an&rsquo;t a condescension you can show the Labourer then, that
he won&rsquo;t take, as ready and as grateful as a man can be;
for, he has a patient, peaceful, willing heart.&nbsp; But you
must put his rightful spirit in him first; for, whether
he&rsquo;s a wreck and ruin such as me, or is like one of them
that stand here now, his spirit is divided from you at this
time.&nbsp; Bring it back, gentlefolks, bring it back!&nbsp;
Bring it back, afore the day comes when even his Bible changes in
his altered mind, and the words seem to him to read, as they have
sometimes read in my own eyes&mdash;in jail: &ldquo;Whither thou
goest, I can Not go; where thou lodgest, I do Not lodge; thy
people are Not my people; Nor thy God my God!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sudden stir and agitation took place in Hall.&nbsp; Trotty
thought at first, that several had risen to eject the man; and
hence this change in its appearance.&nbsp; But, another moment
showed him that the room and all the company had vanished from
his sight, and that his daughter was again before him, seated at
her work.&nbsp; But in a poorer, meaner garret than before; and
with no Lilian by her side.</p>
<p>The frame at which she had worked, was put away upon a shelf
and covered up.&nbsp; The chair in which she had sat, was turned
against the wall.&nbsp; A history was written in these little
things, and in Meg&rsquo;s grief-worn face.&nbsp; Oh! who could
fail to read it!</p>
<p>Meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to
see the threads; and when the night closed in, she lighted her
feeble candle and worked on.&nbsp; Still her old father was
invisible about her; looking down upon her; loving her&mdash;how
dearly loving her!&mdash;and talking to her in a tender voice
about the old times, and the Bells.&nbsp; Though he knew, poor
Trotty, though he knew she could not hear him.</p>
<p>A great part of the evening had worn away, when a knock came
at her door.&nbsp; She opened it.&nbsp; A man was on the
threshold.&nbsp; A slouching, moody, drunken sloven, wasted by
intemperance and vice, and with his matted hair and unshorn beard
in wild disorder; but, with some traces on him, too, of having
been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth.</p>
<p>He stopped until he had her leave to enter; and she, retiring
a pace or two from the open door, silently and sorrowfully looked
upon him.&nbsp; Trotty had his wish.&nbsp; He saw Richard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I come in, Margaret?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; Come in.&nbsp; Come in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was well that Trotty knew him before he spoke; for with any
doubt remaining on his mind, the harsh discordant voice would
have persuaded him that it was not Richard but some other
man.</p>
<p>There were but two chairs in the room.&nbsp; She gave him
hers, and stood at some short distance from him, waiting to hear
what he had to say.</p>
<p>He sat, however, staring vacantly at the floor; with a
lustreless and stupid smile.&nbsp; A spectacle of such deep
degradation, of such abject hopelessness, of such a miserable
downfall, that she put her hands before her face and turned away,
lest he should see how much it moved her.</p>
<p>Roused by the rustling of her dress, or some such trifling
sound, he lifted his head, and began to speak as if there had
been no pause since he entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still at work, Margaret?&nbsp; You work
late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I generally do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And early?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And early.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So she said.&nbsp; She said you never tired; or never
owned that you tired.&nbsp; Not all the time you lived
together.&nbsp; Not even when you fainted, between work and
fasting.&nbsp; But I told you that, the last time I
came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I
implored you to tell me nothing more; and you made me a solemn
promise, Richard, that you never would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A solemn promise,&rsquo; he repeated, with a drivelling
laugh and vacant stare.&nbsp; &lsquo;A solemn promise.&nbsp; To
be sure.&nbsp; A solemn promise!&rsquo;&nbsp; Awakening, as it
were, after a time; in the same manner as before; he said with
sudden animation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I help it, Margaret?&nbsp; What am I to
do?&nbsp; She has been to me again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again!&rsquo; cried Meg, clasping her hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, does she think of me so often!&nbsp; Has she been
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty times again,&rsquo; said Richard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Margaret, she haunts me.&nbsp; She comes behind me in the
street, and thrusts it in my hand.&nbsp; I hear her foot upon the
ashes when I&rsquo;m at my work (ha, ha! that an&rsquo;t often),
and before I can turn my head, her voice is in my ear, saying,
&ldquo;Richard, don&rsquo;t look round.&nbsp; For Heaven&rsquo;s
love, give her this!&rdquo;&nbsp; She brings it where I live: she
sends it in letters; she taps at the window and lays it on the
sill.&nbsp; What <i>can</i> I do?&nbsp; Look at it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He held out in his hand a little purse, and chinked the money
it enclosed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hide it,&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hide it!&nbsp;
When she comes again, tell her, Richard, that I love her in my
soul.&nbsp; That I never lie down to sleep, but I bless her, and
pray for her.&nbsp; That, in my solitary work, I never cease to
have her in my thoughts.&nbsp; That she is with me, night and
day.&nbsp; That if I died to-morrow, I would remember her with my
last breath.&nbsp; But, that I cannot look upon it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He slowly recalled his hand, and crushing the purse together,
said with a kind of drowsy thoughtfulness:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told her so.&nbsp; I told her so, as plain as words
could speak.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve taken this gift back and left it at
her door, a dozen times since then.&nbsp; But when she came at
last, and stood before me, face to face, what could I
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw her!&rsquo; exclaimed Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;You saw
her!&nbsp; O, Lilian, my sweet girl!&nbsp; O, Lilian,
Lilian!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw her,&rsquo; he went on to say, not answering, but
engaged in the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There she stood: trembling!&nbsp; &ldquo;How does she
look, Richard?&nbsp; Does she ever speak of me?&nbsp; Is she
thinner?&nbsp; My old place at the table: what&rsquo;s in my old
place?&nbsp; And the frame she taught me our old work
on&mdash;has she burnt it, Richard!&rdquo;&nbsp; There she
was.&nbsp; I heard her say it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meg checked her sobs, and with the tears streaming from her
eyes, bent over him to listen.&nbsp; Not to lose a breath.</p>
<p>With his arms resting on his knees; and stooping forward in
his chair, as if what he said were written on the ground in some
half legible character, which it was his occupation to decipher
and connect; he went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Richard, I have fallen very low; and you may
guess how much I have suffered in having this sent back, when I
can bear to bring it in my hand to you.&nbsp; But you loved her
once, even in my memory, dearly.&nbsp; Others stepped in between
you; fears, and jealousies, and doubts, and vanities, estranged
you from her; but you did love her, even in my
memory!&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose I did,&rsquo; he said,
interrupting himself for a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s neither here nor there&mdash;&ldquo;O Richard, if
you ever did; if you have any memory for what is gone and lost,
take it to her once more.&nbsp; Once more!&nbsp; Tell her how I
laid my head upon your shoulder, where her own head might have
lain, and was so humble to you, Richard.&nbsp; Tell her that you
looked into my face, and saw the beauty which she used to praise,
all gone: all gone: and in its place, a poor, wan, hollow cheek,
that she would weep to see.&nbsp; Tell her everything, and take
it back, and she will not refuse again.&nbsp; She will not have
the heart!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he sat musing, and repeating the last words, until he woke
again, and rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t take it, Margaret?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, and motioned an entreaty to him to leave
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night, Margaret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned to look upon her; struck by her sorrow, and perhaps
by the pity for himself which trembled in her voice.&nbsp; It was
a quick and rapid action; and for the moment some flash of his
old bearing kindled in his form.&nbsp; In the next he went as he
had come.&nbsp; Nor did this glimmer of a quenched fire seem to
light him to a quicker sense of his debasement.</p>
<p>In any mood, in any grief, in any torture of the mind or body,
Meg&rsquo;s work must be done.&nbsp; She sat down to her task,
and plied it.&nbsp; Night, midnight.&nbsp; Still she worked.</p>
<p>She had a meagre fire, the night being very cold; and rose at
intervals to mend it.&nbsp; The Chimes rang half-past twelve
while she was thus engaged; and when they ceased she heard a
gentle knocking at the door.&nbsp; Before she could so much as
wonder who was there, at that unusual hour, it opened.</p>
<p>O Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this.&nbsp;
O Youth and Beauty, blest and blessing all within your reach, and
working out the ends of your Beneficent Creator, look at
this!</p>
<p>She saw the entering figure; screamed its name; cried
&lsquo;Lilian!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was swift, and fell upon its knees before her: clinging to
her dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up, dear!&nbsp; Up!&nbsp; Lilian!&nbsp; My own
dearest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never more, Meg; never more!&nbsp; Here!&nbsp;
Here!&nbsp; Close to you, holding to you, feeling your dear
breath upon my face!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sweet Lilian!&nbsp; Darling Lilian!&nbsp; Child of my
heart&mdash;no mother&rsquo;s love can be more tender&mdash;lay
your head upon my breast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never more, Meg.&nbsp; Never more!&nbsp; When I first
looked into your face, you knelt before me.&nbsp; On my knees
before you, let me die.&nbsp; Let it be here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have come back.&nbsp; My Treasure!&nbsp; We will
live together, work together, hope together, die
together!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Kiss my lips, Meg; fold your arms about me;
press me to your bosom; look kindly on me; but don&rsquo;t raise
me.&nbsp; Let it be here.&nbsp; Let me see the last of your dear
face upon my knees!&rsquo;</p>
<p>O Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this!&nbsp;
O Youth and Beauty, working out the ends of your Beneficent
Creator, look at this!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me, Meg!&nbsp; So dear, so dear!&nbsp; Forgive
me!&nbsp; I know you do, I see you do, but say so,
Meg!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said so, with her lips on Lilian&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp; And
with her arms twined round&mdash;she knew it now&mdash;a broken
heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His blessing on you, dearest love.&nbsp; Kiss me once
more!&nbsp; He suffered her to sit beside His feet, and dry them
with her hair.&nbsp; O Meg, what Mercy and Compassion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she died, the Spirit of the child returning, innocent and
radiant, touched the old man with its hand, and beckoned him
away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;Fourth Quarter.</h2>
<p>Some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the Bells; some
faint impression of the ringing of the Chimes; some giddy
consciousness of having seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and
reproduced until the recollection of them lost itself in the
confusion of their numbers; some hurried knowledge, how conveyed
to him he knew not, that more years had passed; and Trotty, with
the Spirit of the child attending him, stood looking on at mortal
company.</p>
<p>Fat company, rosy-cheeked company, comfortable company.&nbsp;
They were but two, but they were red enough for ten.&nbsp; They
sat before a bright fire, with a small low table between them;
and unless the fragrance of hot tea and muffins lingered longer
in that room than in most others, the table had seen service very
lately.&nbsp; But all the cups and saucers being clean, and in
their proper places in the corner-cupboard; and the brass
toasting-fork hanging in its usual nook and spreading its four
idle fingers out as if it wanted to be measured for a glove;
there remained no other visible tokens of the meal just finished,
than such as purred and washed their whiskers in the person of
the basking cat, and glistened in the gracious, not to say the
greasy, faces of her patrons.</p>
<p>This cosy couple (married, evidently) had made a fair division
of the fire between them, and sat looking at the glowing sparks
that dropped into the grate; now nodding off into a doze; now
waking up again when some hot fragment, larger than the rest,
came rattling down, as if the fire were coming with it.</p>
<p>It was in no danger of sudden extinction, however; for it
gleamed not only in the little room, and on the panes of
window-glass in the door, and on the curtain half drawn across
them, but in the little shop beyond.&nbsp; A little shop, quite
crammed and choked with the abundance of its stock; a perfectly
voracious little shop, with a maw as accommodating and full as
any shark&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Cheese, butter, firewood, soap, pickles,
matches, bacon, table-beer, peg-tops, sweetmeats, boys&rsquo;
kites, bird-seed, cold ham, birch brooms, hearth-stones, salt,
vinegar, blacking, red-herrings, stationery, lard,
mushroom-ketchup, staylaces, loaves of bread, shuttlecocks, eggs,
and slate pencil; everything was fish that came to the net of
this greedy little shop, and all articles were in its net.&nbsp;
How many other kinds of petty merchandise were there, it would be
difficult to say; but balls of packthread, ropes of onions,
pounds of candles, cabbage-nets, and brushes, hung in bunches
from the ceiling, like extraordinary fruit; while various odd
canisters emitting aromatic smells, established the veracity of
the inscription over the outer door, which informed the public
that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in tea,
coffee, tobacco, pepper, and snuff.</p>
<p>Glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the
shining of the blaze, and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky
lamps which burnt but dimly in the shop itself, as though its
plethora sat heavy on their lungs; and glancing, then, at one of
the two faces by the parlour-fire; Trotty had small difficulty in
recognising in the stout old lady, Mrs. Chickenstalker: always
inclined to corpulency, even in the days when he had known her as
established in the general line, and having a small balance
against him in her books.</p>
<p>The features of her companion were less easy to him.&nbsp; The
great broad chin, with creases in it large enough to hide a
finger in; the astonished eyes, that seemed to expostulate with
themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of
the soft face; the nose afflicted with that disordered action of
its functions which is generally termed The Snuffles; the short
thick throat and labouring chest, with other beauties of the like
description; though calculated to impress the memory, Trotty
could at first allot to nobody he had ever known: and yet he had
some recollection of them too.&nbsp; At length, in Mrs.
Chickenstalker&rsquo;s partner in the general line, and in the
crooked and eccentric line of life, he recognised the former
porter of Sir Joseph Bowley; an apoplectic innocent, who had
connected himself in Trotty&rsquo;s mind with Mrs. Chickenstalker
years ago, by giving him admission to the mansion where he had
confessed his obligations to that lady, and drawn on his unlucky
head such grave reproach.</p>
<p>Trotty had little interest in a change like this, after the
changes he had seen; but association is very strong sometimes;
and he looked involuntarily behind the parlour-door, where the
accounts of credit customers were usually kept in chalk.&nbsp;
There was no record of his name.&nbsp; Some names were there, but
they were strange to him, and infinitely fewer than of old; from
which he argued that the porter was an advocate of ready-money
transactions, and on coming into the business had looked pretty
sharp after the Chickenstalker defaulters.</p>
<p>So desolate was Trotty, and so mournful for the youth and
promise of his blighted child, that it was a sorrow to him, even
to have no place in Mrs. Chickenstalker&rsquo;s ledger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sort of a night is it, Anne?&rsquo; inquired the
former porter of Sir Joseph Bowley, stretching out his legs
before the fire, and rubbing as much of them as his short arms
could reach; with an air that added, &lsquo;Here I am if
it&rsquo;s bad, and I don&rsquo;t want to go out if it&rsquo;s
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blowing and sleeting hard,&rsquo; returned his wife;
&lsquo;and threatening snow.&nbsp; Dark.&nbsp; And very
cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to think we had muffins,&rsquo; said the
former porter, in the tone of one who had set his conscience at
rest.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of night that&rsquo;s meant
for muffins.&nbsp; Likewise crumpets.&nbsp; Also Sally
Lunns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The former porter mentioned each successive kind of eatable,
as if he were musingly summing up his good actions.&nbsp; After
which he rubbed his fat legs as before, and jerking them at the
knees to get the fire upon the yet unroasted parts, laughed as if
somebody had tickled him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re in spirits, Tugby, my dear,&rsquo;
observed his wife.</p>
<p>The firm was Tugby, late Chickenstalker.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Tugby.&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&nbsp; Not
particular.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a little elewated.&nbsp; The muffins
came so pat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he chuckled until he was black in the face; and had
so much ado to become any other colour, that his fat legs took
the strangest excursions into the air.&nbsp; Nor were they
reduced to anything like decorum until Mrs. Tugby had thumped him
violently on the back, and shaken him as if he were a great
bottle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, goodness, lord-a-mercy bless and save
the man!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Tugby, in great terror.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tugby wiped his eyes, and faintly repeated that he found
himself a little elewated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t be so again, that&rsquo;s a dear good
soul,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tugby, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t want to
frighten me to death, with your struggling and
fighting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tugby said he wouldn&rsquo;t; but, his whole existence was
a fight, in which, if any judgment might be founded on the
constantly-increasing shortness of his breath, and the deepening
purple of his face, he was always getting the worst of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it&rsquo;s blowing, and sleeting, and threatening
snow; and it&rsquo;s dark, and very cold, is it, my dear?&rsquo;
said Mr. Tugby, looking at the fire, and reverting to the cream
and marrow of his temporary elevation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hard weather indeed,&rsquo; returned his wife, shaking
her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, aye!&nbsp; Years,&rsquo; said Mr. Tugby,
&lsquo;are like Christians in that respect.&nbsp; Some of
&rsquo;em die hard; some of &rsquo;em die easy.&nbsp; This one
hasn&rsquo;t many days to run, and is making a fight for
it.&nbsp; I like him all the better.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
customer, my love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Attentive to the rattling door, Mrs. Tugby had already
risen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; said that lady, passing out into the
little shop.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I
beg your pardon, sir, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think
it was you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made this apology to a gentleman in black, who, with his
wristbands tucked up, and his hat cocked loungingly on one side,
and his hands in his pockets, sat down astride on the table-beer
barrel, and nodded in return.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a bad business up-stairs, Mrs. Tugby,&rsquo;
said the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;The man can&rsquo;t
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the back-attic can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Tugby,
coming out into the shop to join the conference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,&rsquo; said the gentleman,
&lsquo;is coming down-stairs fast, and will be below the basement
very soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Looking by turns at Tugby and his wife, he sounded the barrel
with his knuckles for the depth of beer, and having found it,
played a tune upon the empty part.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,&rsquo; said the gentleman:
Tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time:
&lsquo;is Going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Tugby, turning to his wife, &lsquo;he
must Go, you know, before he&rsquo;s Gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can move him,&rsquo; said the
gentleman, shaking his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take
the responsibility of saying it could be done, myself.&nbsp; You
had better leave him where he is.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t live
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only subject,&rsquo; said Tugby,
bringing the butter-scale down upon the counter with a crash, by
weighing his fist on it, &lsquo;that we&rsquo;ve ever had a word
upon; she and me; and look what it comes to!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
going to die here, after all.&nbsp; Going to die upon the
premises.&nbsp; Going to die in our house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where should he have died, Tugby?&rsquo; cried his
wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the workhouse,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
are workhouses made for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for that,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tugby, with great
energy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not for that!&nbsp; Neither did I marry you
for that.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think it, Tugby.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
have it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t allow it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be
separated first, and never see your face again.&nbsp; When my
widow&rsquo;s name stood over that door, as it did for many
years: this house being known as Mrs. Chickenstalker&rsquo;s far
and wide, and never known but to its honest credit and its good
report: when my widow&rsquo;s name stood over that door, Tugby, I
knew him as a handsome, steady, manly, independent youth; I knew
her as the sweetest-looking, sweetest-tempered girl, eyes ever
saw; I knew her father (poor old creetur, he fell down from the
steeple walking in his sleep, and killed himself), for the
simplest, hardest-working, childest-hearted man, that ever drew
the breath of life; and when I turn them out of house and home,
may angels turn me out of Heaven.&nbsp; As they would!&nbsp; And
serve me right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her old face, which had been a plump and dimpled one before
the changes which had come to pass, seemed to shine out of her as
she said these words; and when she dried her eyes, and shook her
head and her handkerchief at Tugby, with an expression of
firmness which it was quite clear was not to be easily resisted,
Trotty said, &lsquo;Bless her!&nbsp; Bless her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he listened, with a panting heart, for what should
follow.&nbsp; Knowing nothing yet, but that they spoke of
Meg.</p>
<p>If Tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour, he more
than balanced that account by being not a little depressed in the
shop, where he now stood staring at his wife, without attempting
a reply; secretly conveying, however&mdash;either in a fit of
abstraction or as a precautionary measure&mdash;all the money
from the till into his own pockets, as he looked at her.</p>
<p>The gentleman upon the table-beer cask, who appeared to be
some authorised medical attendant upon the poor, was far too well
accustomed, evidently, to little differences of opinion between
man and wife, to interpose any remark in this instance.&nbsp; He
sat softly whistling, and turning little drops of beer out of the
tap upon the ground, until there was a perfect calm: when he
raised his head, and said to Mrs. Tugby, late Chickenstalker:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s something interesting about the woman,
even now.&nbsp; How did she come to marry him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why that,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tugby, taking a seat near
him, &lsquo;is not the least cruel part of her story, sir.&nbsp;
You see they kept company, she and Richard, many years ago.&nbsp;
When they were a young and beautiful couple, everything was
settled, and they were to have been married on a New Year&rsquo;s
Day.&nbsp; But, somehow, Richard got it into his head, through
what the gentlemen told him, that he might do better, and that
he&rsquo;d soon repent it, and that she wasn&rsquo;t good enough
for him, and that a young man of spirit had no business to be
married.&nbsp; And the gentlemen frightened her, and made her
melancholy, and timid of his deserting her, and of her children
coming to the gallows, and of its being wicked to be man and
wife, and a good deal more of it.&nbsp; And in short, they
lingered and lingered, and their trust in one another was broken,
and so at last was the match.&nbsp; But the fault was his.&nbsp;
She would have married him, sir, joyfully.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen
her heart swell many times afterwards, when he passed her in a
proud and careless way; and never did a woman grieve more truly
for a man, than she for Richard when he first went
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! he went wrong, did he?&rsquo; said the gentleman,
pulling out the vent-peg of the table-beer, and trying to peep
down into the barrel through the hole.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t know that he rightly
understood himself, you see.&nbsp; I think his mind was troubled
by their having broke with one another; and that but for being
ashamed before the gentlemen, and perhaps for being uncertain
too, how she might take it, he&rsquo;d have gone through any
suffering or trial to have had Meg&rsquo;s promise and
Meg&rsquo;s hand again.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my belief.&nbsp; He
never said so; more&rsquo;s the pity!&nbsp; He took to drinking,
idling, bad companions: all the fine resources that were to be so
much better for him than the Home he might have had.&nbsp; He
lost his looks, his character, his health, his strength, his
friends, his work: everything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t lose everything, Mrs. Tugby,&rsquo;
returned the gentleman, &lsquo;because he gained a wife; and I
want to know how he gained her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming to it, sir, in a moment.&nbsp; This
went on for years and years; he sinking lower and lower; she
enduring, poor thing, miseries enough to wear her life
away.&nbsp; At last, he was so cast down, and cast out, that no
one would employ or notice him; and doors were shut upon him, go
where he would.&nbsp; Applying from place to place, and door to
door; and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman who had
often and often tried him (he was a good workman to the very
end); that gentleman, who knew his history, said, &ldquo;I
believe you are incorrigible; there is only one person in the
world who has a chance of reclaiming you; ask me to trust you no
more, until she tries to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Something like that,
in his anger and vexation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, he went to her, and kneeled to her; said it
was so; said it ever had been so; and made a prayer to her to
save him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself, Mrs.
Tugby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She came to me that night to ask me about living
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;What he was once to me,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;is buried in a grave, side by side with what I was to
him.&nbsp; But I have thought of this; and I will make the
trial.&nbsp; In the hope of saving him; for the love of the
light-hearted girl (you remember her) who was to have been
married on a New Year&rsquo;s Day; and for the love of her
Richard.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she said he had come to her from
Lilian, and Lilian had trusted to him, and she never could forget
that.&nbsp; So they were married; and when they came home here,
and I saw them, I hoped that such prophecies as parted them when
they were young, may not often fulfil themselves as they did in
this case, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be the makers of them for a Mine
of Gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman got off the cask, and stretched himself,
observing:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose he used her ill, as soon as they were
married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever did that,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Tugby, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
went on better for a short time; but, his habits were too old and
strong to be got rid of; he soon fell back a little; and was
falling fast back, when his illness came so strong upon
him.&nbsp; I think he has always felt for her.&nbsp; I am sure he
has.&nbsp; I have seen him, in his crying fits and tremblings,
try to kiss her hand; and I have heard him call her
&ldquo;Meg,&rdquo; and say it was her nineteenth birthday.&nbsp;
There he has been lying, now, these weeks and months.&nbsp;
Between him and her baby, she has not been able to do her old
work; and by not being able to be regular, she has lost it, even
if she could have done it.&nbsp; How they have lived, I hardly
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; muttered Mr. Tugby; looking at the till,
and round the shop, and at his wife; and rolling his head with
immense intelligence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like Fighting
Cocks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a cry&mdash;a sound of
lamentation&mdash;from the upper story of the house.&nbsp; The
gentleman moved hurriedly to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; he said, looking back, &lsquo;you
needn&rsquo;t discuss whether he shall be removed or not.&nbsp;
He has spared you that trouble, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saying so, he ran up-stairs, followed by Mrs. Tugby; while Mr.
Tugby panted and grumbled after them at leisure: being rendered
more than commonly short-winded by the weight of the till, in
which there had been an inconvenient quantity of copper.&nbsp;
Trotty, with the child beside him, floated up the staircase like
mere air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Follow her!&nbsp; Follow her!&nbsp; Follow
her!&rsquo;&nbsp; He heard the ghostly voices in the Bells repeat
their words as he ascended.&nbsp; &lsquo;Learn it, from the
creature dearest to your heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was over.&nbsp; It was over.&nbsp; And this was she, her
father&rsquo;s pride and joy!&nbsp; This haggard, wretched woman,
weeping by the bed, if it deserved that name, and pressing to her
breast, and hanging down her head upon, an infant.&nbsp; Who can
tell how spare, how sickly, and how poor an infant!&nbsp; Who can
tell how dear!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; cried Trotty, holding up his folded
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, God be thanked!&nbsp; She loves her
child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman, not otherwise hard-hearted or indifferent to
such scenes, than that he saw them every day, and knew that they
were figures of no moment in the Filer sums&mdash;mere scratches
in the working of these calculations&mdash;laid his hand upon the
heart that beat no more, and listened for the breath, and said,
&lsquo;His pain is over.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better as it
is!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Tugby tried to comfort her with
kindness.&nbsp; Mr. Tugby tried philosophy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; he said, with his hands in his
pockets, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t give way, you know.&nbsp; That
won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; You must fight up.&nbsp; What would have
become of me if <i>I</i> had given way when I was porter, and we
had as many as six runaway carriage-doubles at our door in one
night!&nbsp; But, I fell back upon my strength of mind, and
didn&rsquo;t open it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again Trotty heard the voices saying, &lsquo;Follow
her!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned towards his guide, and saw it rising
from him, passing through the air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Follow
her!&rsquo; it said.&nbsp; And vanished.</p>
<p>He hovered round her; sat down at her feet; looked up into her
face for one trace of her old self; listened for one note of her
old pleasant voice.&nbsp; He flitted round the child: so wan, so
prematurely old, so dreadful in its gravity, so plaintive in its
feeble, mournful, miserable wail.&nbsp; He almost worshipped
it.&nbsp; He clung to it as her only safeguard; as the last
unbroken link that bound her to endurance.&nbsp; He set his
father&rsquo;s hope and trust on the frail baby; watched her
every look upon it as she held it in her arms; and cried a
thousand times, &lsquo;She loves it!&nbsp; God be thanked, she
loves it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He saw the woman tend her in the night; return to her when her
grudging husband was asleep, and all was still; encourage her,
shed tears with her, set nourishment before her.&nbsp; He saw the
day come, and the night again; the day, the night; the time go
by; the house of death relieved of death; the room left to
herself and to the child; he heard it moan and cry; he saw it
harass her, and tire her out, and when she slumbered in
exhaustion, drag her back to consciousness, and hold her with its
little hands upon the rack; but she was constant to it, gentle
with it, patient with it.&nbsp; Patient!&nbsp; Was its loving
mother in her inmost heart and soul, and had its Being knitted up
with hers as when she carried it unborn.</p>
<p>All this time, she was in want: languishing away, in dire and
pining want.&nbsp; With the baby in her arms, she wandered here
and there, in quest of occupation; and with its thin face lying
in her lap, and looking up in hers, did any work for any wretched
sum; a day and night of labour for as many farthings as there
were figures on the dial.&nbsp; If she had quarrelled with it; if
she had neglected it; if she had looked upon it with a
moment&rsquo;s hate; if, in the frenzy of an instant, she had
struck it!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; His comfort was, She loved it
always.</p>
<p>She told no one of her extremity, and wandered abroad in the
day lest she should be questioned by her only friend: for any
help she received from her hands, occasioned fresh disputes
between the good woman and her husband; and it was new bitterness
to be the daily cause of strife and discord, where she owed so
much.</p>
<p>She loved it still.&nbsp; She loved it more and more.&nbsp;
But a change fell on the aspect of her love.&nbsp; One night.</p>
<p>She was singing faintly to it in its sleep, and walking to and
fro to hush it, when her door was softly opened, and a man looked
in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the last time,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William Fern!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the last time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He listened like a man pursued: and spoke in whispers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Margaret, my race is nearly run.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
finish it, without a parting word with you.&nbsp; Without one
grateful word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; she asked: regarding him
with terror.</p>
<p>He looked at her, but gave no answer.</p>
<p>After a short silence, he made a gesture with his hand, as if
he set her question by; as if he brushed it aside; and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s long ago, Margaret, now: but that night is
as fresh in my memory as ever &rsquo;twas.&nbsp; We little
thought, then,&rsquo; he added, looking round, &lsquo;that we
should ever meet like this.&nbsp; Your child, Margaret?&nbsp; Let
me have it in my arms.&nbsp; Let me hold your child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his hat upon the floor, and took it.&nbsp; And he
trembled as he took it, from head to foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it a girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand before its little face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See how weak I&rsquo;m grown, Margaret, when I want the
courage to look at it!&nbsp; Let her be, a moment.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t hurt her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s long ago,
but&mdash;What&rsquo;s her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo; she answered, quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that!&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed to breathe
more freely; and after pausing for an instant, took away his
hand, and looked upon the infant&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; But covered
it again, immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Margaret!&rsquo; he said; and gave her back the
child.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Lilian&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lilian&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I held the same face in my arms when Lilian&rsquo;s
mother died and left her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Lilian&rsquo;s mother died and left her!&rsquo;
she repeated, wildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shrill you speak!&nbsp; Why do you fix your eyes
upon me so?&nbsp; Margaret!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sunk down in a chair, and pressed the infant to her
breast, and wept over it.&nbsp; Sometimes, she released it from
her embrace, to look anxiously in its face: then strained it to
her bosom again.&nbsp; At those times, when she gazed upon it,
then it was that something fierce and terrible began to mingle
with her love.&nbsp; Then it was that her old father quailed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Follow her!&rsquo; was sounded through the house.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Learn it, from the creature dearest to your
heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo; said Fern, bending over her, and
kissing her upon the brow: &lsquo;I thank you for the last
time.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp; Good bye!&nbsp; Put your hand in
mine, and tell me you&rsquo;ll forget me from this hour, and try
to think the end of me was here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; she asked again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be a Fire to-night,&rsquo; he said,
removing from her.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be Fires this
winter-time, to light the dark nights, East, West, North, and
South.&nbsp; When you see the distant sky red, they&rsquo;ll be
blazing.&nbsp; When you see the distant sky red, think of me no
more; or, if you do, remember what a Hell was lighted up inside
of me, and think you see its flames reflected in the
clouds.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp; Good bye!&rsquo;&nbsp; She called
to him; but he was gone.&nbsp; She sat down stupefied, until her
infant roused her to a sense of hunger, cold, and darkness.&nbsp;
She paced the room with it the livelong night, hushing it and
soothing it.&nbsp; She said at intervals, &lsquo;Like Lilian,
when her mother died and left her!&rsquo;&nbsp; Why was her step
so quick, her eye so wild, her love so fierce and terrible,
whenever she repeated those words?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, it is Love,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
Love.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll never cease to love it.&nbsp; My poor
Meg!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dressed the child next morning with unusual care&mdash;ah,
vain expenditure of care upon such squalid robes!&mdash;and once
more tried to find some means of life.&nbsp; It was the last day
of the Old Year.&nbsp; She tried till night, and never broke her
fast.&nbsp; She tried in vain.</p>
<p>She mingled with an abject crowd, who tarried in the snow,
until it pleased some officer appointed to dispense the public
charity (the lawful charity; not that once preached upon a
Mount), to call them in, and question them, and say to this one,
&lsquo;Go to such a place,&rsquo; to that one, &lsquo;Come next
week;&rsquo; to make a football of another wretch, and pass him
here and there, from hand to hand, from house to house, until he
wearied and lay down to die; or started up and robbed, and so
became a higher sort of criminal, whose claims allowed of no
delay.&nbsp; Here, too, she failed.</p>
<p>She loved her child, and wished to have it lying on her
breast.&nbsp; And that was quite enough.</p>
<p>It was night: a bleak, dark, cutting night: when, pressing the
child close to her for warmth, she arrived outside the house she
called her home.&nbsp; She was so faint and giddy, that she saw
no one standing in the doorway until she was close upon it, and
about to enter.&nbsp; Then, she recognised the master of the
house, who had so disposed himself&mdash;with his person it was
not difficult&mdash;as to fill up the whole entry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&rsquo; he said softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have come
back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the child, and shook her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you have lived here long enough
without paying any rent?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think that,
without any money, you&rsquo;ve been a pretty constant customer
at this shop, now?&rsquo; said Mr. Tugby.</p>
<p>She repeated the same mute appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose you try and deal somewhere else,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And suppose you provide yourself with another
lodging.&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you could manage
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said in a low voice, that it was very late.&nbsp;
To-morrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I see what you want,&rsquo; said Tugby; &lsquo;and
what you mean.&nbsp; You know there are two parties in this house
about you, and you delight in setting &rsquo;em by the
ears.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want any quarrels; I&rsquo;m speaking
softly to avoid a quarrel; but if you don&rsquo;t go away,
I&rsquo;ll speak out loud, and you shall cause words high enough
to please you.&nbsp; But you shan&rsquo;t come in.&nbsp; That I
am determined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hair back with her hand, and looked in a sudden
manner at the sky, and the dark lowering distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the last night of an Old Year, and I
won&rsquo;t carry ill-blood and quarrellings and disturbances
into a New One, to please you nor anybody else,&rsquo; said
Tugby, who was quite a retail Friend and Father.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wonder you an&rsquo;t ashamed of yourself, to carry such
practices into a New Year.&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t any
business in the world, but to be always giving way, and always
making disturbances between man and wife, you&rsquo;d be better
out of it.&nbsp; Go along with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Follow her!&nbsp; To desperation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again the old man heard the voices.&nbsp; Looking up, he saw
the figures hovering in the air, and pointing where she went,
down the dark street.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She loves it!&rsquo; he exclaimed, in agonised entreaty
for her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Chimes! she loves it still!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Follow her!&rsquo;&nbsp; The shadow swept upon the
track she had taken, like a cloud.</p>
<p>He joined in the pursuit; he kept close to her; he looked into
her face.&nbsp; He saw the same fierce and terrible expression
mingling with her love, and kindling in her eyes.&nbsp; He heard
her say, &lsquo;Like Lilian!&nbsp; To be changed like
Lilian!&rsquo; and her speed redoubled.</p>
<p>O, for something to awaken her!&nbsp; For any sight, or sound,
or scent, to call up tender recollections in a brain on
fire!&nbsp; For any gentle image of the Past, to rise before
her!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was her father!&nbsp; I was her father!&rsquo; cried
the old man, stretching out his hands to the dark shadows flying
on above.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have mercy on her, and on me!&nbsp; Where
does she go?&nbsp; Turn her back!&nbsp; I was her
father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But they only pointed to her, as she hurried on; and said,
&lsquo;To desperation!&nbsp; Learn it from the creature dearest
to your heart!&rsquo;&nbsp; A hundred voices echoed it.&nbsp; The
air was made of breath expended in those words.&nbsp; He seemed
to take them in, at every gasp he drew.&nbsp; They were
everywhere, and not to be escaped.&nbsp; And still she hurried
on; the same light in her eyes, the same words in her mouth,
&lsquo;Like Lilian!&nbsp; To be changed like Lilian!&rsquo;&nbsp;
All at once she stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, turn her back!&rsquo; exclaimed the old man,
tearing his white hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;My child!&nbsp; Meg!&nbsp;
Turn her back!&nbsp; Great Father, turn her back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her own scanty shawl, she wrapped the baby warm.&nbsp; With
her fevered hands, she smoothed its limbs, composed its face,
arranged its mean attire.&nbsp; In her wasted arms she folded it,
as though she never would resign it more.&nbsp; And with her dry
lips, kissed it in a final pang, and last long agony of Love.</p>
<p>Putting its tiny hand up to her neck, and holding it there,
within her dress, next to her distracted heart, she set its
sleeping face against her: closely, steadily, against her: and
sped onward to the River.</p>
<p>To the rolling River, swift and dim, where Winter Night sat
brooding like the last dark thoughts of many who had sought a
refuge there before her.&nbsp; Where scattered lights upon the
banks gleamed sullen, red, and dull, as torches that were burning
there, to show the way to Death.&nbsp; Where no abode of living
people cast its shadow, on the deep, impenetrable, melancholy
shade.</p>
<p>To the River!&nbsp; To that portal of Eternity, her desperate
footsteps tended with the swiftness of its rapid waters running
to the sea.&nbsp; He tried to touch her as she passed him, going
down to its dark level: but, the wild distempered form, the
fierce and terrible love, the desperation that had left all human
check or hold behind, swept by him like the wind.</p>
<p>He followed her.&nbsp; She paused a moment on the brink,
before the dreadful plunge.&nbsp; He fell down on his knees, and
in a shriek addressed the figures in the Bells now hovering above
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have learnt it!&rsquo; cried the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;From the creature dearest to my heart!&nbsp; O, save her,
save her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could wind his fingers in her dress; could hold it!&nbsp;
As the words escaped his lips, he felt his sense of touch return,
and knew that he detained her.</p>
<p>The figures looked down steadfastly upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have learnt it!&rsquo; cried the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, have mercy on me in this hour, if, in my love for her,
so young and good, I slandered Nature in the breasts of mothers
rendered desperate!&nbsp; Pity my presumption, wickedness, and
ignorance, and save her.&rsquo;&nbsp; He felt his hold
relaxing.&nbsp; They were silent still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have mercy on her!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;as one
in whom this dreadful crime has sprung from Love perverted; from
the strongest, deepest Love we fallen creatures know!&nbsp; Think
what her misery must have been, when such seed bears such
fruit!&nbsp; Heaven meant her to be good.&nbsp; There is no
loving mother on the earth who might not come to this, if such a
life had gone before.&nbsp; O, have mercy on my child, who, even
at this pass, means mercy to her own, and dies herself, and
perils her immortal soul, to save it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was in his arms.&nbsp; He held her now.&nbsp; His strength
was like a giant&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see the Spirit of the Chimes among you!&rsquo; cried
the old man, singling out the child, and speaking in some
inspiration, which their looks conveyed to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know that our inheritance is held in store for us by Time.&nbsp;
I know there is a sea of Time to rise one day, before which all
who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves.&nbsp;
I see it, on the flow!&nbsp; I know that we must trust and hope,
and neither doubt ourselves, nor doubt the good in one
another.&nbsp; I have learnt it from the creature dearest to my
heart.&nbsp; I clasp her in my arms again.&nbsp; O Spirits,
merciful and good, I take your lesson to my breast along with
her!&nbsp; O Spirits, merciful and good, I am
grateful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He might have said more; but, the Bells, the old familiar
Bells, his own dear, constant, steady friends, the Chimes, began
to ring the joy-peals for a New Year: so lustily, so merrily, so
happily, so gaily, that he leapt upon his feet, and broke the
spell that bound him.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;And whatever you do, father,&rsquo; said Meg,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t eat tripe again, without asking some doctor
whether it&rsquo;s likely to agree with you; for how you
<i>have</i> been going on, Good gracious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was working with her needle, at the little table by the
fire; dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her
wedding.&nbsp; So quietly happy, so blooming and youthful, so
full of beautiful promise, that he uttered a great cry as if it
were an Angel in his house; then flew to clasp her in his
arms.</p>
<p>But, he caught his feet in the newspaper, which had fallen on
the hearth; and somebody came rushing in between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried the voice of this same somebody; a
generous and jolly voice it was!&nbsp; &lsquo;Not even you.&nbsp;
Not even you.&nbsp; The first kiss of Meg in the New Year is
mine.&nbsp; Mine!&nbsp; I have been waiting outside the house,
this hour, to hear the Bells and claim it.&nbsp; Meg, my precious
prize, a happy year!&nbsp; A life of happy years, my darling
wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Richard smothered her with kisses.</p>
<p>You never in all your life saw anything like Trotty after
this.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care where you have lived or what you
have seen; you never in all your life saw anything at all
approaching him!&nbsp; He sat down in his chair and beat his
knees and cried; he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and
laughed; he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed
and cried together; he got out of his chair and hugged Meg; he
got out of his chair and hugged Richard; he got out of his chair
and hugged them both at once; he kept running up to Meg, and
squeezing her fresh face between his hands and kissing it, going
from her backwards not to lose sight of it, and running up again
like a figure in a magic lantern; and whatever he did, he was
constantly sitting himself down in his chair, and never stopping
in it for one single moment; being&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
truth&mdash;beside himself with joy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to-morrow&rsquo;s your wedding-day, my pet!&rsquo;
cried Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your real, happy
wedding-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-day!&rsquo; cried Richard, shaking hands with
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;To-day.&nbsp; The Chimes are ringing in the New
Year.&nbsp; Hear them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They <span class="smcap">were</span> ringing!&nbsp; Bless
their sturdy hearts, they <span class="smcap">were</span>
ringing!&nbsp; Great Bells as they were; melodious, deep-mouthed,
noble Bells; cast in no common metal; made by no common founder;
when had they ever chimed like that, before!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, to-day, my pet,&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You and Richard had some words to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s such a bad fellow, father,&rsquo;
said Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo;t you, Richard?&nbsp; Such a
headstrong, violent man!&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have made no more of
speaking his mind to that great Alderman, and putting <i>him</i>
down I don&rsquo;t know where, than he would of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;Kissing Meg,&rsquo; suggested Richard.&nbsp;
Doing it too!</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Not a bit more,&rsquo; said Meg.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t let him, father.&nbsp; Where would
have been the use!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Richard my boy!&rsquo; cried Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
was turned up Trumps originally; and Trumps you must be, till you
die!&nbsp; But, you were crying by the fire to-night, my pet,
when I came home!&nbsp; Why did you cry by the fire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking of the years we&rsquo;ve passed
together, father.&nbsp; Only that.&nbsp; And thinking that you
might miss me, and be lonely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trotty was backing off to that extraordinary chair again, when
the child, who had been awakened by the noise, came running in
half-dressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, here she is!&rsquo; cried Trotty, catching her
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s little Lilian!&nbsp; Ha ha
ha!&nbsp; Here we are and here we go!&nbsp; O here we are and
here we go again!&nbsp; And here we are and here we go! and Uncle
Will too!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stopping in his trot to greet him
heartily.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, Uncle Will, the vision that I&rsquo;ve
had to-night, through lodging you!&nbsp; O, Uncle Will, the
obligations that you&rsquo;ve laid me under, by your coming, my
good friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Will Fern could make the least reply, a band of music
burst into the room, attended by a lot of neighbours, screaming
&lsquo;A Happy New Year, Meg!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A Happy
Wedding!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Many of &rsquo;em!&rsquo; and other
fragmentary good wishes of that sort.&nbsp; The Drum (who was a
private friend of Trotty&rsquo;s) then stepped forward, and
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trotty Veck, my boy!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got about, that
your daughter is going to be married to-morrow.&nbsp; There
an&rsquo;t a soul that knows you that don&rsquo;t wish you well,
or that knows her and don&rsquo;t wish her well.&nbsp; Or that
knows you both, and don&rsquo;t wish you both all the happiness
the New Year can bring.&nbsp; And here we are, to play it in and
dance it in, accordingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which was received with a general shout.&nbsp; The Drum was
rather drunk, by-the-bye; but, never mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a happiness it is, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said
Trotty, &lsquo;to be so esteemed!&nbsp; How kind and neighbourly
you are!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all along of my dear daughter.&nbsp;
She deserves it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were ready for a dance in half a second (Meg and Richard
at the top); and the Drum was on the very brink of feathering
away with all his power; when a combination of prodigious sounds
was heard outside, and a good-humoured comely woman of some fifty
years of age, or thereabouts, came running in, attended by a man
bearing a stone pitcher of terrific size, and closely followed by
the marrow-bones and cleavers, and the bells; not <i>the</i>
Bells, but a portable collection on a frame.</p>
<p>Trotty said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs.
Chickenstalker!&rsquo;&nbsp; And sat down and beat his knees
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married, and not tell me, Meg!&rsquo; cried the good
woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t rest on the
last night of the Old Year without coming to wish you joy.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t have done it, Meg.&nbsp; Not if I had been
bed-ridden.&nbsp; So here I am; and as it&rsquo;s New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, and the Eve of your wedding too, my dear, I had
a little flip made, and brought it with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chickenstalker&rsquo;s notion of a little flip did honour
to her character.&nbsp; The pitcher steamed and smoked and reeked
like a volcano; and the man who had carried it, was faint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Tugby!&rsquo; said Trotty, who had been going
round and round her, in an ecstasy.&mdash;&lsquo;I <i>should</i>
say, Chickenstalker&mdash;Bless your heart and soul!&nbsp; A
Happy New Year, and many of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Mrs. Tugby,&rsquo;
said Trotty when he had saluted her;&mdash;&lsquo;I <i>should</i>
say, Chickenstalker&mdash;This is William Fern and
Lilian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The worthy dame, to his surprise, turned very pale and very
red.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Lilian Fern whose mother died in
Dorsetshire!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Her uncle answered &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and meeting hastily,
they exchanged some hurried words together; of which the upshot
was, that Mrs. Chickenstalker shook him by both hands; saluted
Trotty on his cheek again of her own free will; and took the
child to her capacious breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will Fern!&rsquo; said Trotty, pulling on his
right-hand muffler.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not the friend you was hoping to
find?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&rsquo; returned Will, putting a hand on each of
Trotty&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp; &lsquo;And like to prove
a&rsquo;most as good a friend, if that can be, as one I
found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&rsquo; said Trotty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please to play up
there.&nbsp; Will you have the goodness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the music of the band, and, the bells, the marrow-bones and
cleavers, all at once; and while the Chimes were yet in lusty
operation out of doors; Trotty, making Meg and Richard, second
couple, led off Mrs. Chickenstalker down the dance, and danced it
in a step unknown before or since; founded on his own peculiar
trot.</p>
<p>Had Trotty dreamed?&nbsp; Or, are his joys and sorrows, and
the actors in them, but a dream; himself a dream; the teller of
this tale a dreamer, waking but now?&nbsp; If it be so, O
listener, dear to him in all his visions, try to bear in mind the
stern realities from which these shadows come; and in your
sphere&mdash;none is too wide, and none too limited for such an
end&mdash;endeavour to correct, improve, and soften them.&nbsp;
So may the New Year be a happy one to you, happy to many more
whose happiness depends on you!&nbsp; So may each year be happier
than the last, and not the meanest of our brethren or sisterhood
debarred their rightful share, in what our Great Creator formed
them to enjoy.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
